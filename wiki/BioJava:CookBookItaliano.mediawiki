== BioJava In Anger - Un tutorial e una raccolta di "ricette" per coloro che hanno fretta ==

BioJava can be both big and intimidating. For those of us who are in a hurry there really is a whole lot there to get your head around. This document is designed to help you develop BioJava programs that do 99% of common tasks without needing to read and understand 99% of the BioJava API.

The page was inspired by various programming cookbooks and follows a "How do I...?" type approach. Each "How do I?" is linked to some example code that does what you want and sometimes more. Basically if you find the code you want and copy and paste it into your program you should be up and running quickly. I have endeavoured to over document the code to make it more obvious what I am doing so some of the code might look a bit bloated.

If you have any suggestions, questions or comments contact the [mailto:biojava-l@biojava.org biojava mailing list]. To subscribe to this list go [http://biojava.org/mailman/listinfo/biojava-l here]
