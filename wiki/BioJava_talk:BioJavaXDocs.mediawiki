Is there any usable version of biojavax?
And, where can I find biosql workable with biojava1.4?

Biojavax is currently only available from CVS (public or development server). The BioSQL schema is also available from BioSQL the CVS. Instructions for getting both can be found on the open-bio source code [http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/SourceCode page].

Hello, colleagues!

I've left some comments on my [[User_talk:Seeker#I.27ve_noticed_some_misprints_in_BioJavaX_Documentation_and_in_the_source_code.|discussion page]]. I think it may be interesting to contributors. Especially for BioJavaX coders.
