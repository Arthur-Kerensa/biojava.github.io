= BioJava Maven migration and modularization =

BioJava is currently in the process of getting migrated to Maven and split up into sub-modules. A code freeze on this SVN trunk has been declared for

'''Thursday August 27th 23:00 GMT'''.

After this the code base will be re-factored and future development will happen on a new location in SVN. New SVN checkout instructions will be provided as soon as the modularization has reached a state that is stable enough.

== Procedure ==

* declare code freeze

* I will refactor the code into the modules and commit the new version at a new location in the SVN.

* Documentation will be updated to reflect the new organization

* All developers should obtain a new checkout

* We need to identify leaders for the development of the sub-modules. View the current [[BioJava:Modules|list of defined modules]] 

* Continue development on the new modules

* Finalize the new version of BioJava at the upcoming Hackaton

* release!
