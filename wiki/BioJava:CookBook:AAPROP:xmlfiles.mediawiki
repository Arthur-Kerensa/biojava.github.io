===How should I define the XML files to customize mass of Amino Acids in the computation of Molecular Weight?===

There are two XML files which you would need to define in order to customize mass of Amino Acids.

1) ElementMass - This file should define the name and mass of elements and isotopes.

2) AminoAcidComposition - This file should define all the elements and isotopes that are contained for each Amino Acid.

===Required Attributes in XML files===

* AminoAcidComposition
** "symbol" - Single character and case-insensitive but must not be repeated.
** "name" - Case-sensitive and must be defined in the ElementMass XML file.
** "count" - Must be greater than 0.

* ElementMass
** "name" - Case-senstitive.
** "mass" - Mass of the element/isotope. Must be greater than 0.

===Standard===

For ease of use, the <b>standard</b> mass of elements and isotopes are already saved in [[BioJava:CookBook:AAPROP:ElementMass.xml|ElementMass.xml]]. <br/>
Likewise, the <b>standard</b> composition of amino acids are also stored in [[BioJava:CookBook:AAPROP:AminoAcidComposition.xml|AminoAcidComposition.xml]].

===Minimum===

Also, for ease of understanding and manipulation, we have also defined another two files which are contains the <b>minimum</b> requirements needed.<br/>
[[BioJava:CookBook:AAPROP:MinElementMass.xml|MinElementMass.xml]] and [[BioJava:CookBook:AAPROP:MinAminoAcidComposition.xml|MinAminoAcidComposition.xml]].
