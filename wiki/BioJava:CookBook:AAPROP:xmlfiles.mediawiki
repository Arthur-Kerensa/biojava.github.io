===How should I define the XML files to customize mass of Amino Acids in the computation of Molecular Weight?===

There are two XML files which you would need to define in order to customize mass of Amino Acids.

1) ElementMass - This file should define the name and mass of elements and isotopes.

2) AminoAcidComposition - This file should define all the elements and isotopes that are contained for each Amino Acid.

===Standard===

For ease of use, the <b>standard</b> mass of elements and isotopes are already saved in [[BioJava:CookBook:AAPROP:ElementMass.xml|ElementMass.xml]]. 
Likewise, the <b>standard</b> composition of amino acids are also stored in [[BioJava:CookBook:AAPROP:AminoAcidComposition.xml|AminoAcidComposition.xml]].

===Minimum===

Also, for ease of understanding and manipulation, we have also defined another two files which are the <b>minimum</b> requirements for the above two files.
[[BioJava:CookBook:AAPROP:MinElementMass.xml|MinElementMass.xml]] and [[BioJava:CookBook:AAPROP:MinAminoAcidComposition.xml|MinAminoAcidComposition.xml]].
