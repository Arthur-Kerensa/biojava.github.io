===How is Aliphatic Index computed?===
The aliphatic index of a protein is defined as the relative volume occupied by aliphatic side chains (alanine, valine, isoleucine, and leucine).<br/> 
It may be regarded as a positive factor for the increase of thermostability of globular proteins.
<p>
Aliphatic index = ( (Ala count) + a * (Val count) + b * (Ile count) + b * (Leu count) ) * 100 where a = 2.9 and b = 3.9<br/>
