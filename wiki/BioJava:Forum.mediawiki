=== dbSNP objects for BioJava ===

I started working with a research team focusing in genomics and observed that there is nothing in BioJava to deal with dbSNP infos. I setup a (very) simple NCBIdbSNP class that can fetch single dbSNP entries and represent them as RichSequences. Anybody would have insights on the subject where I could go with this?

Sounds interesting. How do you represent the SNP on the RichSequence? Is it a Feature? Does dbSNP contain frequency information for the SNPs? If it does it would be possible to represent each SNP as a Distribution. You could make a simple extension of RichFeature that stores a Distribution or possibly embed it into the RichAnnotation for the feature (best to do it as a string rather than as a Distribution in this case).
