==Work in progress ...==

'''WARNING:[[User:Vincent Rouilly|Vincent Rouilly]] 15:18, 17 August 2009 (UTC)''': this is a very preliminary tutorial. It worked for me, but this tutorial would need some more inputs to be more robust. Please drop your comments / feedback at the bottom of the page if you have given it a try.

===Prerequisites===
* Java 1.5
* Eclipse 3.4.1 + Google App Engine plug-in from http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/eclipse.html
* Dazzle code into /tmp/dazzle from: svn checkout http://www.derkholm.net/svn/repos/dazzle/trunk /tmp/dazzle

===Installation Steps===

# Create new Google App Engine project from Eclipse (after Google Engine plug-in installation):
## Project name: dazzle
## Package: org.biojava.servlets.dazzle
## Uncheck 'Use Google Web Toolkit'
## Finish

# Import 'dazzle' Jar files into 'dazzle google engine' project
## In Eclipse, 'dazzle' project Properties -> Java Build Path -> Add  External Jars
## Import from /tmp/dazzle/jars: bioJava.jar, bytecode.jar, dasmi-model.jar, servlet-api-2.3.jar
# Import 'dazzle' ressources folder into 'dazzle google engine' project
## drag-and-drop /tmp/dazzle/resources folder into 'Eclipse:/dazzle' folder      
# Import 'dazzle' src files into 'dazzle google engine' project
## drag-and-drop /tmp/dazzle/src/org folder into 'Eclipse:/ dazzle/src' folder
## Comment: you should have 3 errors due to the use of Context in 'MysqlFeatureCache'. For now, I just commented the 2 lines involved.
# Import /tmp/dazzle/dazzle-webapp files into 'dazzle google engine' project
# drag-and-drop files from /tmp/dazzle/dazzle-webapp into Eclipse:/dazzle/war/.  (do not select WEB-INF folder)
# Import Jars to WEB-INF/lib
## drag and drop jar files from /tmp/dazzle/jars into 'dazzle google engine' Eclipse:/dazzle/war/WEB-INF/lib
## biojava.jar, bytecode.jar, dasmi-model.jar, servelt-api-2.3.jar, dazzle.jar
# Update web.xml file in Eclipse:/dazzle/war/WEB-INF/

# Run application in Eclipse as web Application (standalone test)
## check with your web browser: http://localhost:8080/das/dsn
# If it works, you can create a Google App Engine Application ID and deploy your dazzle server on the cloud.
