== What needs doing? ==

* About BioJava
* Getting BioJava - easy 
* Thanks - already done
* Getting Started (Done --[[User:Foisys|Foisys]] 12:49, 6 February 2006 (EST))
* Tutorial - laborious but straightforward, some parts are in need of updating and/or are no longer relevant
* Cookbook (BioJava in Anger) - as per Tutorial but there's much more of it, very laborious indeed (lots of copy and paste). (By start IÂ´ll work here. --[[User:Guedes|Guedes]] 15:50, 6 February 2006 (EST)) (French version: working on it - --[[User:Foisys|Foisys]] 12:36, 6 February 2006 (EST))
* JavaDoc 1.3 - how? link back to old? Links to old established --[[User:Mark|Mark]] 12:13, 6 February 2006 (EST)
* JavaDoc 1.4 - how? link back to old? Links to old established --[[User:Mark|Mark]] 12:13, 6 February 2006 (EST)
* Hackers Guide - Done --[[User:Foisys|Foisys]] 16:37, 6 February 2006 (EST)
* Participants - Mostly links to user pages. eg User:Mark. This is not ideal. Jason is going to set up a People domain then we can set User:Mark to redirect to People:Mark Schreiber
* Download 1.3 - easy (best to link back to old download?)
* Download 1.4 - easy (FTP location?)		 
* CVS access - easy 
* WebCVS - easy 
* User mailing list - easy
* Susbcribe to mailing list - easy
* Mailing list archive - not sure how to transfer this? Probably link to old archive
* Dev mailing list stuff - as per user mailing list
* Related sites eg bioperl, biopython etc - easy, could use interwiki
