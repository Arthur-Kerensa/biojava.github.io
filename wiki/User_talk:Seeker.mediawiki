== I've noticed some misprints in BioJavaX Documentation and in the source code. ==

----


[[BioJava:BioJavaXDocs#Writing_2|Here]] in [[BioJava:BioJavaXDocs|BioJavaXDocs]] it is said that GenBank Field FEATURE can be outputted as follows:

"...For the source feature, the db_xref and organism fields are added to the output by calling '''getNCBITaxon().getNCBITaxID()''' and '''getNCBITaxon().getDisplayName()''' on the ''sequence'' (the latter is chopped before the first bracket if necessary)...."

If I clearly understand, the '''RichSequence''' object is ment by ''sequence''. But there is no '''getNCBITaxon()''' method in the '''RichSequence''' class. There is '''getTaxon()''' method in the '''RichSequence''' class. Thus, exectly this method should be used here instead of '''getNCBITaxon()''' method.
