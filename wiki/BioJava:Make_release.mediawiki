==How to make a BioJava release==

This page is intended for BioJava release managers. I was documenting this while I was doing the BioJava 1.7 release. --[[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 15:14, 12 April 2009 (UTC)

===Required time===
A few hours. Most time is being spent in verifying that the code base is release ready. The actual preparation of the .jar files and copying them to the open-bio.org server is quite quick and can be done semi-automatic.

===Prior to release===
* Announce release deadlines on mailing list

=== Prepare your release server ===

Make sure you have access to a server that has the ssh keys setup for cloudportal.open-bio.org. If you need help with that, talk to root@open-bio.org.

==On release date==

'''Verify code base'''

* Make sure code is ready for release. Check last minute commits (there usually are some).
* Make sure the auto-build page (cruisecontrol) does not report any problems

===Make maven release===

the release process is very straightforward nowadays. 

 mvn release:clean 

 mvn release:prepare 

 mvn release:perform

If all three steps work fine, the biggest part of the release has been completed!. The next steps are just updates of documentation. If something went wrong you can reset the release process by doing:

 mvn release:rollback

===Prepare and release javadoc files===

 cd biojava-git/target/checkout/

remove .git files  (for preparing -all file)

 find ./ -name ".git" | xargs rm -Rf

build javadoc:

 mvn site

 cd biojava-svn/target/checkout/target/site/

Here we assume the version nr. of the current release is 3.0.7.

  mv apidocs/ api3.0.7

  tar cvf api3.0.3.tar api3.0.7/
 
  gzip api3.0.7.tar

  scp api3.0.7.tar.gz username@cloudportal.open-bio.org:/home/websites/biojava.org/html/static/docs/

now log into the couldportal server:

 ssh andreas@cloudportal.open-bio.org

 cd /home/websites/biojava.org/html/static/docs/

 tar zxvf api3.0.7.tar.gz

 rm api
 
 ln -s api3.0.7 api

and back to your local machine...

=== Create the biojava-all bundle ===

in biojava-svn/target

 mv checkout/ bj3.0.7

 tar zcvf bj3.0.7.tar.gz bj3.0.7

 mv bj3.0.7.tar.gz biojava-3.0.7-all.tar.gz
 
on portal.open-bio

 cd /home/websites/biojava.org/html/static/download

 mkdir bj3.0.7

back to your local machine

 scp biojava-3.0.7-all.tar.gz andreas@cloudportal.open-bio.org:/home/websites/biojava.org/html/static/download/bj3.0.7

=== Javadocs ===

this is how to enable analytics in javadocs

 cd biojava-svn/target/bj3.0.7/

 mvn clean install source:jar javadoc:jar deploy javadoc:aggregate

 cd biojava-svn/target/bj3.0.7/target/site/apidocs

upload apidocs

=== Update the wikipedia pages to link to the new release===

Create a new download file for the release. (I copied [[BioJava:Download_3.0.4]] to [[BioJava:Download_3.0.5]]). Modify the new page to the latest data.

Update [[BioJava:Download]] (Change the redirect on the BioJava:Download page to [[BioJava:Download_3.0.5]])

Update the [[MediaWiki:Sidebar]] to point to the new Javadoc api

=== AND FINALLY ===

Write release announcement to biojava-l and biojava-dev
