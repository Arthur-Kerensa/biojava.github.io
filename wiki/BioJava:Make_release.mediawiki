==How to make a BioJava release==

This page is intended for BioJava release managers.

This is how I released BioJava 1.7 --[[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 15:14, 12 April 2009 (UTC)

===Prior to release===
* Announce release deadlines on mailing list

===On release date===

=== In your local checkout ===

* Make sure code is ready for release. Check last minute commits (there usually are some).
* Make sure the auto-build page (cruisecontrol) does not report any problems
* Run 
 ant-clean; ant runtests;
* make sure there are no broken tests being reported

If this all fine up to here, we are ready for release.

* Branch and tag the svn directories.
 svn copy the trunk to the corresponding directories in the /branches and /tags directories of the svn repository.
* edit the build.xml file and change the '''version''' field to the number of the current release.
* Run
 ant-clean; ant dist;
* check that the javadocs have been built ok, first page should show the number of the current release/
 open file:///path/to/your/local/dir/biojava-live/dist/biojava-1.7/doc/biojava/index.html
* prepare the biojava-all.jar bundle
 enter the /dist subdirectory of your biojava
* do a
 jar cvf biojava-1.7-all.jar

===On portal.open-bio.org ===
* log into the server. go to /home/websites/biojava.org/html/static/download/ and create a new directory for the new release. See directory structure in other release how to organise this.

* copy file to 
 scp biojava-1.7-all.jar username@portal.open-bio.org:/home/websites/biojava.org/html/static/download/bj17/all
