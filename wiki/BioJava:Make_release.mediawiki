==How to make a BioJava release==

This page is intended for BioJava release managers. I was documenting this while I was doing the BioJava 1.7 release. --[[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 15:14, 12 April 2009 (UTC)

===Required time===
A few hours. Most time is being spent in verifying that the code base is release ready. The actual preparation of the .jar files and copying them to the open-bio.org server is quite quick and can be done semi-automatic.

===Prior to release===
* Announce release deadlines on mailing list

===On release date===

'''Verify code base'''

* Make sure code is ready for release. Check last minute commits (there usually are some).
* Make sure the auto-build page (cruisecontrol) does not report any problems
* Run 
 ant clean; ant runtests
* make sure there are no broken tests being reported.
* fix anything that needs to be fixed prior to release.

If this all fine up to here, we are ready for release.

'''Branch and Tag SVN'''
* Branch and tag the svn directories. svn copy the trunk to the corresponding directories in the /branches and /tags directories of the svn repository.
 svn cp -m "branching 1.8.2 release" \
  svn+ssh://dev.open-bio.org/home/svn-repositories/biojava/biojava-live/trunk \
  svn+ssh://dev.open-bio.org/home/svn-repositories/biojava/biojava-live/branches/release-1_8_2-branch

 svn cp -m "tagging 1.8.2 release" \
  svn+ssh://dev.open-bio.org/home/svn-repositories/biojava/biojava-live/trunk \
  svn+ssh://dev.open-bio.org/home/svn-repositories/biojava/biojava-live/tags/release-1_8_2
* Verify that all went well
 svn list svn+ssh://dev.open-bio.org/home/svn-repositories/biojava/biojava-live/branches
 svn list svn+ssh://dev.open-bio.org/home/svn-repositories/biojava/biojava-live/tags

'''Build the release'''
* edit the build.xml file and change the '''version''' field to the number of the current release.
* Run
 ant clean; ant dist
* check that the javadocs have been built ok, first page should show the number of the current release/
 open file:///path/to/your/local/dir/biojava-live/dist/biojava-1.8/doc/biojava/index.html
* prepare the biojava-all.jar bundle 
 cd dist; jar cvf biojava-1.8.2-all.jar biojava-1.8.2

===Copy files to portal.open-bio.org ===
* Log into the portal.open-bio.org server. go to /home/websites/biojava.org/html/static/download/ and create a new directory for the new release. See directory structure in other release how to organise this.

* Copy file biojava-all.jar
 scp biojava-1.8.2-all.jar username@portal.open-bio.org:/home/websites/biojava.org/html/static/download/bj18/all

'''Back in your local checkout'''
* remove the /dist subdirectory from your checkout. Not needed any longer.
* Make the doc release bundle
 ant clean; ant javadocs-all; cd ant-build; jar cvf biojava-1.8.2-doc.jar docs/
* Copy file biojava-doc.jar
 scp biojava-1.8.2-doc.jar username@portal.open-bio.org:/home/websites/biojava.org/html/static/download/bj18/doc/biojava-docs.jar
* Prepare the bin release: 
 ant clean; ant
* Copy file biojava.jar 
 scp ant-build/biojava.jar username@portal.open-bio.org:/home/websites/biojava.org/html/static/download/bj18/bin/
* Prepare the src release:
 ant clean; cd .. ; jar cvf biojava-1.8.2-src.jar biojava-live
 scp biojava-1.8.2-src.jar username@portal.open-bio.org:/home/websites/biojava.org/html/static/download/bj18/src/

=== Update Javadoc docu on portal.open-bio.org===

Almost done... The last thing is to update the public javadoc files.
For this, we need to recompile the javadocs and add a hook to the google analytics tracker, we are using on the website. use the modified [[BioJava:my_build_biojava|my_build_biojava.xml]]. (update the version variable in the file to your release number)
 ant -buildfile my_build_biojava.xml javadocs-biojava
Then copy the newly created javadoc files to the public server.
 cd ant-build/docs/; tar cvf javadocs-server.tar ./biojava/
 scp javadocs-server.tar username@portal.open-bio.org:~/
The files are now in your home directory on the server. Untar the files on portal.open-bio.org:
 tar xvf javadocs-server.tar
The files are now in your home directory on the server. We need to hook them into the frontend:
 cd /home/websites/biojava.org/html/static/docs/
 mkdir api18
 cp -r ~/biojava/* ./api18/
verify that all went ok by pointing your browser to
 http://www.biojava.org/docs/api18/
update the symbolic link to the javadoc api
 point /home/websites/biojava.org/html/static/docs/api to api18

=== Update the wikipedia pages to link to the new release===

Create a new download file for the release. (I copied [[BioJava:Download_1.6]] to [[BioJava:Download_1.7]]). Modify the new page to the latest data.

Update [[BioJava:Download]] (Change the redirect on the BioJava:Download page to [[BioJava:Download_1.8]])

Update the [[MediaWiki:Sidebar]] to point to the new Javadoc api

=== AND FINALLY ===

Write release announcement to biojava-l and biojava-dev
