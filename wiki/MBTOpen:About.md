MBT Open
--------

MBT Open is an [open-source](wp:Open source "wikilink"),
[Java](http://www.java.sun.com)-based protein visualization and analysis
toolkit. The toolkit builds upon BioJava to provide classes for
efficiently loading, managing and manipulating protein structure and
sequence data. The MBT Open excels especially in providing a rich set of
state-of-the-art 3d-accellerated graphical visualization components, as
well as 2D visualization components which can be easily "plugged
together" to produce applications having sophisticated graphical user
interfaces. Yet, with all of the GUI components provided in the toolkit,
the core data i/o and manipulation classes may be used to write
completely non-graphical applications (say, for implementing pure
analysis codes, or, for producing a non-graphical "back end" for
web-based applications).

History
-------

MBT Open originated from a mature library called the Molecular Biology
Toolkit, developed under its own grant by John Moreland and others at
the [San Diego Supercomputer Center](http://www.sdsc.edu) (SDSC). The
project was then taken under the umbrella of the [Protein
Databank](http://www.pdb.org) (PDB). Several web-deployed applications
were created and deployed to the main PDB website, as well as the
[IEDB](http://www.immuneepitope.org/home.do) website, and are being
maintained both in their roles on the PDB website and as examples for
developers of MBT Open projects. The PDB contributed the Molecular
Biology Toolkit code to the BioJava effort in 2008 in order to make it
more accessible to a larger audience of developers and users.

Goals
-----

The MBT Open project seeks to contribute to the
[open-source](wp:Open source "wikilink") Bioinformatics community in the
following ways:

-   For the Non-computational Biologist: Provide an easily configurable
    set of 3d protein visualization tools aimed at a variety of
    biological disciplines
-   For the Bioinformatics tool developer: Provide a state-of-the-art,
    cross-platform library for structural biology visualization and
    analysis, with a robust plugin system to allow easy extension
-   For the Bioinformatics computational researcher: Provide a forum and
    experimentation bed for 3d protein visualization techniques and
    other structural biology computational themes

Current Viewers Based on MBT Open
---------------------------------

-   Available at the [RCSB PDB](http://www.rcsb.org):
    -   Protein Workshop: a 3d protein viewer aimed at general viewing
        and publication-quality image generation
    -   Ligand Explorer: a 3d protein viewer aimed at visualization and
        analysis of ligands
    -   ![](SimpleViewerOverview.png "fig:SimpleViewerOverview.png")
        Simple Viewer: a 3d protein viewer aimed at visualization of
        biological units and especially large repeated unit structures
        such as viral capsids
-   Available at the [IEDB](http://www.immuneepitope.org/home.do):
    -   Epitope Viewer: a 3d protein viewer aimed at visualization and
        analysis of immunologically relevant epitope information

Source Code and Downloads
-------------------------

Source code and downloads will be available very soon.
