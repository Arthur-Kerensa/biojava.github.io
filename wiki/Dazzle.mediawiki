=Dazzle=

Dazzle is an easy to use server for the Distributed Annotation System ([http://www.biodas.org DAS]). 

It is implemented as a Java servlet, using the BioJava APIs. Dazzle is a modular system which uses small "datasource" plugins to provide access to a range of databases. Several [[Dazzle:plugins|general-purpose plugins]] are included in the package, and it it straightforward to [[Dazzle:writeplugin| develop new plugins]] to connect to your own databases.

Dazzle has been developed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute by [[Thomas_Down|Thomas Down]].
