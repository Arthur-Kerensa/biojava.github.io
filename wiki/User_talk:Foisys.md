-   Just to let you know, we have had some problems on the othe Bio\*
    wiki sites with spammers. You should go ahead and create a
    `Index.php` page, then protect it for sysops only
    ([Bioperl](http://bioperl.org) and [Biopython](http://biopython.org)
    both resorted to this). Also, the Bioperl and Biopython wikis have
    set up a Blacklist page which is supposed to cut down on the amount
    of spam. Don't know if you have that
    here. --[Cjfields](User:Cjfields "wikilink") 15:36, 11 August 2006
