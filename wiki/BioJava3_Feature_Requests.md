title: BioJava3 Feature Requests
---

The following features are missing from the current BioJava3.

If you are looking for a programming project and are interested in
contributing any of these please contact the biojava-dev mailing list.

-   Balibase
-   UniProt (XML/txt)
-   port the BioJava 1 Chromatogram parser to BioJava 3
-   Variation APIs that bring together Ensembl Variation, VCF file
    format, GFF3+GVF file format, samtools, Picard, GATK, etc.
-   SCOP2 parser (See [Github
    issue](https://github.com/biojava/biojava/issues/82))

There are also a number of algorithms where we would be interested in
[Java ports](Algorithm_Java_port "wikilink").

You can also take a look at the current list of [ BioJava
Modules](BioJava:Modules#BioJava_3.0.X "wikilink") and suggest other
missing features.
