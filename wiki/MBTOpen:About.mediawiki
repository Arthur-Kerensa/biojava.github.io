== MBT Open ==

MBT Open is an [[wp:Open source|open-source]], [http://www.java.sun.com Java]-based protein visualization and analysis toolkit. The toolkit builds upon BioJava to provide classes for efficiently loading, managing and manipulating protein structure and sequence data. The MBT Open excels especially in providing a rich set of state-of-the-art 3d-accellerated graphical visualization components, as well as 2D visualization components which can be easily "plugged together" to produce applications having sophisticated graphical user interfaces. Yet, with all of the GUI components provided in the toolkit, the core data i/o and manipulation classes may be used to write completely non-graphical applications (say, for implementing pure analysis codes, or, for producing a non-graphical "back end" for web-based applications).

== History ==

MBT Open originated from a mature library called the Molecular Biology Toolkit, developed under its own grant by John Moreland and others at the [http://www.sdsc.edu San Diego Supercomputer Center] (SDSC). The project was then taken under the umbrella of the [http://www.pdb.org Protein Databank] (PDB). Several web-deployed applications were created and deployed to the main PDB website, as well as the [http://www.immuneepitope.org/home.do IEDB] website, and are being maintained both in their roles on the PDB website and as examples for developers of MBT Open projects. The PDB contributed the Molecular Biology Toolkit code to the BioJava effort in 2008 in order to make it more accessible to a larger audience of developers and users.

== Goals ==

The MBT Open project seeks to contribute to the [[wp:Open source|open-source]] Bioinformatics community in the following ways:
* For the Non-computational Biologist: Provide an easily configurable set of 3d protein visualization tools aimed at a variety of biological disciplines
* For the Bioinformatics tool developer: Provide a state-of-the-art, cross-platform library for structural biology visualization and analysis, with a robust plugin system to allow easy extension
* For the Bioinformatics computational researcher: Provide a forum and experimentation bed for 3d protein visualization techniques and other structural biology computational themes
