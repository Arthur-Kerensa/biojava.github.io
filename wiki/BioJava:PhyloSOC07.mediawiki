This page will include all info and docs about our efforts in the 2007 Google Summer of Code as part of the NESCent phyloinformatics group.


'''<APIs for BioJava: Project Plan>'''


''Week 0 (~ May 20th) :'' Building project plan, Program set-up (Java, Eclipse and BioJava, JGraphT), Reading NEXUS paper, etc.   


----

'''Part I : Development of basic I/O'''
----


'''''Week 1 (May 21st ~ May 27th) Development of basic Input'''''
	
- Input: Nucleic acid sequences (practice w/ FASTA format and create API for NEXUS format)

- Initialization: create objects for each sequence


Day 1: Practice w/ FASTA parser

Day 2: Getting to know NEXUS parser(1) (read and parse the TAXA, CHARACTER block) 

Day 3: Getting to know NEXUS parser(2) (TREE block)

Day 4: Tree building practice w/ JGraphT

Day 5/6: Extend functions for NEXUS parser (parse a tree block and create tree by JGraphT)

Day 7: Other Blocks (if necessary) 


----

''Week 2 Development of basic Output''
	
- Tree constructing practice with JGraphT (http://www.jgrapht.org/javadoc/ )

- Output file creation in NEXUS format(converting tree object into NEXUS format)



'''Part II: Distance method (multiple hit correction method)'''

''Week 3 Jukes-Cantor''

''Week 4 Kimura's 2-parameter''


'''Part III: Distance based phylogeny reconstruction'''

''week5 UPGMA method & Neighbor-Joining method''


[UPGMA]

1. finding shortest distance within distance matrix

2. calculate branch lengths as distance/2

3. build a sub-tree for that pair

4. collapse a pair (changes distance into 0)

5. repeat process expanding/combining trees


[N-J]

1. S = total branch length of tree

2. separate pair of taxa from all others

3. choose pair of taxa that minimizes S

4. build a sub-tree for that pair

5. collapse pair as distance and recalculate distance matrix

6. next pair that gives smallest S is chosen

7. repeat until complete


''Week 6 Documentation for Part I & II & III'' : (JavaDoc and BJ website)


'''Part III : Maximum Parsimony'''

''Week 7 & 8  Maxumum Parsimony Method''

1. aligning sequences

2. decide informative sites (2 or more differences)

3. create tree type and calculate # of base changes for that tree

4. repeat step 3 for all informative sites

5. for each tree type, add # of changes for all sites

6. find the tree with smallest number of changes



'''Part IV : Maximum Likelihood'''

''Week 9 & 10  Maxumum Likelihood Method''

1. aligning sequences

2. define possible tree types

3. for each tree, calculate 
   L = multiply Pr(D|T) for every sites
   Pr(D|T) = (prob. for the tree from certain ancestral base)

4. find a tree with maximum likelihood


'''Part V : Phylogeny supporting method'''

''Week 11 Bootstrap method''

1. replicate alignments

- taking the original sequence alignment

- entire column is randomly sampled(w/ replacement)

2. for each re-sampled replicate alignment, reconstruct phylogeny based on the method

3. count the number of replicates that each internal branch of the original tree is found
