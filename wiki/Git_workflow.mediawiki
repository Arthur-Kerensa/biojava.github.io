Git is a very flexible versioning system. There are often multiple ways to accomplish a task. Here are some recommended workflows for BioJava.

== Using github ==

It is strongly advised to create a personal fork on github. This allows new features to be fully developed before being merged into the main repository. Some resources to help with this:

* [https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo Github: Fork a repo]
* [https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests Github: Using pull requests]

== Merging options ==

Assume you are working in local fork, and that you have a remote 'main' which points to the main biojava repository:
 <nowiki>$ git remote -v
main    https://github.com/biojava/biojava.git (fetch)
main    https://github.com/biojava/biojava.git (push)
origin  https://github.com/<username>/biojava-sbliven.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/<username>/biojava-sbliven.git (push)</nowiki>

You've started a branch 'feature' and made a few commits, so now your repository now looks like this:

 A -- B -- C <- master, main/master
       \
        -- D -- E <- feature

Now you want to merge your changes back into main/master. There are several ways which this can be accomplished 

# Push the changes to your github fork, then issue a pull request
# Merge the feature branch into master locally, then push changes to the main repository (requires developer permission)
# Rebase your changes onto master, then push changes to the main repository (requires developer permission)
