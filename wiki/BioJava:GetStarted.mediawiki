== Introduction ==

BioJava will run on any computer with a Java virtual machine complying to the Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE) 1.6 (or later) specifications. Java implementations for Linux, Windows, and Solaris are available to download from [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/ Oracle's java website]. Recent versions of MacOS X include a suitable Java implementation as standard. Java is also available on many other platforms: if in doubt, contact your vendor. BioJava binaries are distributed in .jar (Java ARchive) format.

You can get the latest version [[Biojava:Download|BioJava3 (v3.0.1) (requires Java 1.6+)]] from the [[Biojava:Download|download area]].

You can get the latest version [[Biojava:Download_1.8|BioJava1 (v1.8.1) (requires Java 1.5+)]] from the [[Biojava:Download_1.8|BJ1 download area]] . 

You can also integrate BioJava with  NetBeans IDE. To find out how follow this [[How_to_integrate_BioJava_in_NetBeans_IDE|link]].

A step by step guide on 'How to integrate BioJava in Nebtbeans' is [[BioJava-Installation_Guide.png|link]].

== Installation ==

None of these .jar files need to be unpacked for normal use -- simply place them in a convenient directory.

To use BioJava, add the required JAR files to your CLASSPATH environment variable. The exact syntax varies between platforms. The text is wrapped due to limited space. The actual commands should be on a single line:

=== UNIX Bourne-type shells (the default with most Linux distributions and MacOS 10.3) ===

 export CLASSPATH=/home/thomas/biojava-live.jar:/home/thomas/bytecode.jar:
                         /home/thomas/commons-cli.jar:
                         /home/thomas/commons-collections-2.1.jar:
                         /home/thomas/commons-dbcp-1.1.jar:
                         /home/thomas/commons-pool-1.1.jar:.

In some distributions of Biojava, you need to specify biojava.jar instead of biojava-live.jar in the above. We are working on resolving this.

=== UNIX C-type shell (for example: versions of Mac OS X pre-10.3)===

 setenv CLASSPATH /home/thomas/biojava-live.jar:/home/thomas/bytecode.jar:
                         /home/thomas/commons-cli.jar:
                         /home/thomas/commons-collections-2.1.jar:
                         /home/thomas/commons-dbcp-1.1.jar:
                         /home/thomas/commons-pool-1.1.jar:.

In some distributions of Biojava, you need to specify biojava.jar instead of biojava-live.jar in the above. We are working on resolving this.

=== Windows from command line ===

 set CLASSPATH C:\biojava-live.jar;C:\bytecode.jar;C:\commons-cli.jar;
                         C:\commons-collections-2.1.jar;C:\commons-dbcp-1.1.jar;
                         C:\commons-dbcp-1.1.jar;.

In some distributions of Biojava, you need to specify biojava.jar instead of biojava-live.jar in the above. We are working on resolving this.

=== Windows autoexec.bat files ===

 set CLASSPATH=C:\biojava-live.jar;C:\bytecode.jar;C:\commons-cli.jar;
                         C:\commons-collections-2.1.jar;C:\commons-dbcp-1.1.jar;
                         C:\commons-pool-1.1.jar;.

In some distributions of Biojava, you need to specify biojava.jar instead of biojava-live.jar in the above. We are working on resolving this.

It is also possible to "install" JAR files onto your system by copying them into your Java installation's extensions directory. On most Unix systems, this is named ''${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/ext''. On Mac OS X there is a per-user extensions directory called ''~/Library/Java/Extensions'' (you may have to create this directory yourself). For other platforms, consult your Java vendor.

You can now compile and run BioJava programs using the ''javac'' and ''java'' commands. You might like to look at the developer section on the [http://www.biojava.org/wiki/Main_Page Main page] for documentation, cookbook and tutorials. Finally, you can learn a lot about BioJava by trying the demo programs included in the source distribution (see below).

==  Building your own ==

If you want to modify BioJava, you can obtain a copy of the source code from the download areas. Source releases are distributed in .tar.gz format. You can also obtain up-to-the-minute source code via either the [http://biojava.org/download/maven/ Maven repository] or an [[CVS_to_SVN_Migration| anonymous SVN checkout]].

BioJava is now built using [http://maven.apache.org/ Apache Maven]. 

== Building the demo programs ==

The source distribution contains a number of small demo programs. Once you have a working ''biojava.jar'' on your classpath, these can be compiled directly using ''javac'' from the demos directory.

  (unix)
  cd demos
  javac seq/TestEmbl.java
  java seq.TestEmbl seq/AL121903.embl
  
  (windows)
  cd demos
  javac seq\TestEmbl.java
  java seq.TestEmbl seq\AL121903.embl
