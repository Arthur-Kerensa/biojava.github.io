== Introduction ==

BioJava will run on any computer with a Java virtual machine complying to the Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE) 1.6 (or later) specifications. Java implementations for Linux, Windows, and Solaris are available to download from [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/ Oracle's java website]. Recent versions of MacOS X include a suitable Java implementation as standard. Java is also available on many other platforms: if in doubt, contact your vendor. BioJava binaries are distributed in .jar (Java ARchive) format.

You can get the latest version [[Biojava:Download|BioJava3 (v3.0.1) (requires Java 1.6+)]] from the [[Biojava:Download|download area]].

You can get the latest version [[Biojava:Download_1.8|BioJava1 (v1.8.1) (requires Java 1.5+)]] from the [[Biojava:Download_1.8|BJ1 download area]] . 

You can also integrate BioJava with  NetBeans IDE. To find out how follow this [[How_to_integrate_BioJava_in_NetBeans_IDE|link]].

A step by step guide on 'How to integrate BioJava in Nebtbeans IDE' is [[BioJava-Installation_Guide.png|here]].

== Maven ==

BioJava uses[http://maven.apache.org/ Maven] as a build and distribution system. If you are new to Maven, take a look at the [http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html Getting Started with Maven] guide.

We are providing a BioJava specific Maven repository at http://biojava.org/download/maven/ .

You can add the BioJava repository by adding the following XML to your project pom.xml file:
<pre>
        <repositories>
		...
		<repository>
			<id>biojava-maven-repo</id>
			<name>BioJava repository</name>
			<url>http://www.biojava.org/download/maven/</url>			
		</repository>
	</repositories>

        <dependencies>
                ...
                <dependency>
                        <groupId>org.biojava</groupId>
                        <artifactId>biojava3-core</artifactId>
                        <version>3.0.2</version>
                </dependency>
                <!-- other biojava jars as needed -->
        </dependencies>
	
</pre>

== Installation ==

None of these .jar files need to be unpacked for normal use -- simply place them in a convenient directory.

To use BioJava, add the required JAR files to your CLASSPATH environment variable. The exact syntax varies between platforms.

It is also possible to "install" JAR files onto your system by copying them into your Java installation's extensions directory. On most Unix systems, this is named ''${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/ext''. On Mac OS X there is a per-user extensions directory called ''~/Library/Java/Extensions'' (you may have to create this directory yourself). For other platforms, consult your Java vendor.

You can now compile and run BioJava programs using the ''javac'' and ''java'' commands. You might like to look at the developer section on the [http://www.biojava.org/wiki/Main_Page Main page] for documentation, cookbook and tutorials. Finally, you can learn a lot about BioJava by trying the demo programs included in the source distribution (see below).

==  Building your own ==

If you want to modify BioJava, you can obtain a copy of the source code from the download areas. Source releases are distributed in .tar.gz format. You can also obtain up-to-the-minute source code via either the [http://biojava.org/download/maven/ Maven repository] or an [[CVS_to_SVN_Migration| anonymous SVN checkout]].

BioJava is now built using [http://maven.apache.org/ Apache Maven]. 

== Building the demo programs ==

The source distribution contains a number of small demo programs. Once you have a working ''biojava.jar'' on your classpath, these can be compiled directly using ''javac'' from the demos directory.

  (unix)
  cd demos
  javac seq/TestEmbl.java
  java seq.TestEmbl seq/AL121903.embl
  
  (windows)
  cd demos
  javac seq\TestEmbl.java
  java seq.TestEmbl seq\AL121903.embl
