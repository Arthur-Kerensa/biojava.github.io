I got involved with BioJava through working with [Mark
Schreiber](User:Mark "wikilink") on the
[dengueinfo](http://www.dengueinfo.org/) project, which required BioJava
to be able to work seamlessly with [BioSQL](http://biosql.org/)
databases. As this was not completely possible in version 1.4, we
produced the BioJavaX extensions to be release in version 1.5 that allow
BioJava to use the Hibernate framework for accessing BioSQL.

I currently work at the [Genome Institute of
Singapore](http://www.gis.a-star.edu.sg/) but will soon be moving to the
[EBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/) at Hinxton to join the
[BioMart](http://www.biomart.org) team."
