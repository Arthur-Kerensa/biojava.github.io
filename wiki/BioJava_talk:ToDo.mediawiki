== WebCVS, CVS and Mailing list pages ==

Is there really a need to move the CVS and mailing list pages into the Wiki? These are special pages/interfaces to specific web applications. I also think it would be a quite difficult job to do so. So my proposal is to change nothing, instead just to link to it from the Wiki.

== First tutorial online ==

I've formatted the [[BioJava:Tutorial:Symbols_and_SymbolLists|first tutorial]]. Any feedback, suggestions, etc.? The usage of <nowiki><code>...</code></nowiki> is not consistent in the original [http://www.biojava.org/tutorials/chap1.html page]. Any guidelines when to format the namens of classes, interfaces, methods, etc.?
