Hi - I moved your entry in the Discussion section since it might generate comments that are outside the scope of the CookBook. Actually your idea is quite interesting. Why not make a page with some of the papers that were created using BioJava and come back to the Cookbook page and add the link? --[[User:Foisys|Foisys]] 15:19, 6 February 2006 (EST)
