== BioJava at GSoC Introduction ==

Google has not announced yet if there will be a Google Summer of Code 2013. This page is to prepare possible projects for if/when the GSoC announcement comes out.

If you want to propose a project, have a look at the [[BioJava:Modules]] page, for areas which are currently under development. Also take a look at the [[BioJava3_Feature_Requests|Feature Requests]] page. There are also some ideas from last year at [[Google_Summer_of_Code_2012]]

Please read the [http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code GSoC page at the Open Bioinformatics Foundation] and the [http://code.google.com/soc main Google Summer of Code page] for more details about the program.
