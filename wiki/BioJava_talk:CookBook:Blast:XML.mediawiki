Hi to all,

Not to bitch or anything but should the cookbook be about specifically using BJ classes to solve bioinformatics tasks? This page is pretty much about using Java's XML features on a XML-formatted Blast report. 

Please do not interpret this comment as objecting to your contribution (far from me) but should we be thinking about creating some repositories of more generic Java stuff or point users toward other more general web resources?

Just my own .02 cents and I am open to discuss this ;-)
