===How are Absorbance and Extinction Coefficient computed?===

==Extinction Coefficient==

Extinct(Prot) = (Tyr count)*Ext(Tyr) + (Trp count)*Ext(Trp) + (Cys count)*Ext(Cys) where Ext(Tyr) = 1490, Ext(Trp) = 5500, Ext(Cys) = 125

==Absorbance== 

Absorb(Prot) = Extinct(Prot) / Molecular_Weight


There is a boolean parameter to be set - assumeCysReduced.<br/> 
If assumeCysReduced is set to true, (Cys count) will always be 0.<br/>
If assumeCysReduced is set to false, Every pair of Cystine will be counted as 1.<br/>
Our approach is based on [http://web.expasy.org/protparam/protparam-doc.html here].
