At the end of March 2013, BioJava will move from SVN to GIT for version control.

== Benefits of the move ==

* Use branches in your daily workflow without merge terror
* Track buggy/untested code without breaking the build for everyone else
* Collaborate within a small team before sharing the finished feature
* Simple, well integrated bug tracking
* Accept contributions from the public via pull requests

== Current Situation ==

The primary BioJava SVN repository requires an ssh account for each developer. As described in [http://biojava.org/w/index.php?title=Developer_Code_Access&oldid=5082 Developer Code Access]), the repository url is 

  svn co svn+ssh://dev.open-bio.org/home/svn-repositories/biojava/biojava-live/trunk/

There are also two read-only mirrors which permit anonymous access. The recommended public access point for SVN is

  svn co http://code.open-bio.org/repos/biojava/biojava-live/trunk

A commit hook is used to update a github mirror after each commit. This repository is read-only (by policy). Although it is possible to develop from a GIT clone & submit push-requests with new code, none such requests are accepted. Github repositories can be accessed using either GIT (recommended) or SVN<ref>Github blog. [https://github.com/blog/626-announcing-svn-support Announcing SVN support].

  git clone https://github.com/biojava/biojava.git

  svn co --depth empty https://github.com/biojava/biojava
  svn up biojava/trunk
  
Neither of these methods are recommended, although they have been suggested to work around open-bio.org server problems.
