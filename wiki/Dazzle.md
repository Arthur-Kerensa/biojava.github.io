Dazzle is a [DAS](bp:DAS "wikilink") server library.

Dazzle is a general purpose server for the Distributed Annotation System
(DAS) protocol. It is implemented as a Java servlet, using the BioJava
APIs. Dazzle is a modular system which uses small "datasource" plugins
to provide access to a range of databases. Several general-purpose
plugins are included in the package, and it it straightforward to
develop new plugins to connect to your own databases.

The code and repository have relocated to [Thomas
Down](Thomas Down "wikilink")'s
[site](http://www.derkholm.net/thomas/dazzle/).
