=== How do I read a .mmcif file? ===

[http://ndbserver.rutgers.edu/mmcif/index.html mmcif] is an alternative file format to PDB files ( [[#westbrook2000|1]],[[#westbrook2003|2]] ).
It is not entirely easy to write a parser for it, as such BioJava solves this problem for you. The mmcif files are parsed into the same BioJava data structure as the [[BioJava::CookBook:PDB:read]]
