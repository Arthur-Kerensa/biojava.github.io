This is how far I (--[[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 03:42, 24 October 2008 (UTC)) got so far:

* I am using the [http://maven.apache.org/eclipse-plugin.html Maven] eclipse plugin.

* Checked out the project as a Java project

* right click on the pom.xml and Run As -> Maven install

* at the moment it fails since 1.6 is required and my operating system (osx 10.4.11) does not have that...
