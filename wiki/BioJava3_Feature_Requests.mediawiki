The following features are missing from the current BioJava3.

If you are looking for a programming project and are interested in contributing any of these please contact the biojava-dev mailing list, or browse open feature requests on [https://github.com/biojava/biojava/issues/ Github].

* Balibase
* UniProt (XML/txt)
* port the BioJava 1 Chromatogram parser to BioJava 3
* Variation APIs that bring together Ensembl Variation, VCF file format, GFF3+GVF file format, samtools, Picard, GATK, etc.
* SCOP2 parser (See [https://github.com/biojava/biojava/issues/82 Github issue])

There are also a number of algorithms where we would be interested in [[Algorithm_Java_port|Java ports]].

You can also take a look at the current list of [[BioJava:Modules#BioJava_3.0.X| BioJava Modules]] and suggest other missing features.
