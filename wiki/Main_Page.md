Welcome to BioJava
------------------

See the [BioJava news page](http://biojava.open-bio.org/news) for
BioJava news.

This site is built by the biojava community. We are currently in the
process of moving the old biojava site to this site. Click
[here](Project:ToDo "wikilink") for a todo list.

About BioJava
-------------

BioJava is an [open-source](wp:Open source "wikilink") project dedicated
to providing a [Java](http://www.java.sun.com) framework for processing
biological data. It include objects for manipulating biological
sequences, file parsers, [DAS](http://biodas.org/) client and server
suport, access to [BioSQL](http://www.biosql.org/) and
[Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org) databases, tools for making sequence
analysis GUIs and powerful analysis and statistical routines including a
dynamic programming toolkit.

Getting BioJava
---------------

BioJava is distributed under the terms of the GNU [Lesser
GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html). This means that you can use
the libraries without your software being forced under either the LGPL
or [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html). LGPL is not GPL.

BioJava releases can be obtained from our
[download](Project:download "wikilink") area. Instructions for
installing the library, and building source releases, can be found on
the [Getting started](Project:GetStarted "wikilink") page.

You can also maintain an up-to-date view of BioJava with
[CVS](http://www.cvs.org/). We provide anonymous
[CVS](wp:Concurrent Versions System "wikilink") server. If you wish to
contribute your existing code or help maintain part of the BioJava
code-base, then we can supply you with a read/write account. Sign up for
the biojava-dev mailing list and post a request for an account.

New Logo Needed!
----------------

The BioJava project needs a new Logo. The sunflower in the top left
corner of this page doesn't really do it justice. If you have artistic
flair then upload you logo to this [page](Project:logo "wikilink").
Everyone feel free to make your comments about which ones you like. At
some as yet undecided point one will become the official
logo. --[Mark](User:Mark "wikilink") 21:21, 1 February 2006 (EST)

Documentation

### Cookbook

BioJava can be both big and intimidating. For those of us who are in a
hurry there really is a whole lot there to get your head around. This
document is designed to help you develop BioJava programs that do 99% of
common tasks without needing to read and understand 99% of the BioJava
API.

The page was inspired by various programming cookbooks and follows a
"How do I...?" type approach. Each "How do I?" is linked to some example
code that does what you want and sometimes more. Basically if you find
the code you want and copy and paste it into your program you should be
up and running quickly. I have endeavoured to over document the code to
make it more obvious what I am doing so some of the code might look a
bit bloated. Go [here](Biojava:Cookbook "wikilink") to view the
cookbook.

'BioJava in Anger' is maintained by [Mark
Schreiber](User:Mark "wikilink"). If you have any suggestions, questions
or comments contact the [biojava mailing
list](mailto:biojava-l@biojava.org). To subscribe to this list go

thank Chris Dagdigian from [The Bioteam](http://www.bioteam.net/) for
maintaining the bio\* servers.
