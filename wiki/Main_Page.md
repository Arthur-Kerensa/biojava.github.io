About BioJava
-------------

BioJava is an [open-source](wp:Open source "wikilink") project dedicated
to providing a [Java](http://www.java.sun.com) framework for processing
biological data. It include objects for manipulating biological
sequences, file parsers, [DAS](http://biodas.org/) client and server
support, access to [BioSQL](http://www.biosql.org/) and
[Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org) databases, tools for making sequence
analysis GUIs and powerful analysis and statistical routines including a
dynamic programming toolkit.

BioJava is used in several real-world [bioinformatics
applications](Project:BioJavaInside "wikilink") and has been used for
bioinformatics analysis in a number of [published
studies](Project:BioJavaInside "wikilink").

Getting BioJava
---------------

BioJava is distributed under the terms of the GNU [Lesser
GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html). This means that you can use
the libraries without your software being forced under either the LGPL
or [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html). LGPL is not GPL.

BioJava releases can be obtained from our
[download](Project:download "wikilink") area. Instructions for
installing the library, and building source releases, can be found on
the [Getting started](Project:GetStarted "wikilink") page.

You can also maintain an up-to-date view of BioJava with
[CVS](http://www.cvs.org/). Additionally, we provide an [anonymous
CVS](http://cvs.biojava.org/) server.

If you wish to contribute your existing code or help maintain part of
the BioJava code-base, then we can supply you with a read/write account.
Sign up for the [biojava-dev mailing
list](http://www.biojava.org/mailman/listinfo/biojava-dev) and post a
request for an account.

BioJava 1.5 Release Planning
----------------------------

BioJava 1.5-Beta3 is now available from the [download
area](Biojava:Download "wikilink"). --[Mark](User:Mark "wikilink")
02:37, 8 June 2007 (EDT)

Planning has begun for a new BioJava release. The [release
plan](Project:1.5ReleasePlan "wikilink") has been drawn up. Soon we will
be asking for a volunteer to be the [Release Czar](Czar "wikilink") to
oversee the coordination of the release.

Bugs and Requests for enhancement
---------------------------------

BioJava probably contains the odd bug, who would have thought!! We make
use of the [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org) bug reporting and
tracking system. You can use it to
[submit](http://bugzilla.open-bio.org/) a new bug or request for
enhancement or to [view](http://bugzilla.open-bio.org/) open bugs or
known issues.

Documentation
-------------

### Cookbook

The biojava project maintains a cookbook of examples that help you
perform common tasks and get you started using biojava. The cookbook is
affectionately known as [Biojava in Anger](BioJava:Cookbook "wikilink").
A [French version](BioJava:CookbookFrench "wikilink") is also available.

### API Documentation (JavaDocs)

The following are links to API documentation autogenerated by javadoc.

    1.3)](http://www.biojava.org/docs/api/index.html)
-   [API docs (BioJava version
    1.4)](http://www.biojava.org/docs/api14/index.html)
-   [API docs (BioJava version
    1.5-Beta2)](http://www.biojava.org/docs/api15b/index.html)

### BioJava Tutorial

The BioJava tutorial is [here](BioJava:Tutorial "wikilink")

### BioJavaX Documentation

This documentation is just as much under development as the code it
refers to, so use with care. It is a rough guide rather than a detailed
description.

    format)](BioJava:BioJavaXDocs "wikilink")

### Dazzle

The [Dazzle](Dazzle "wikilink") DAS server repository and documentation
has been moved to a new
[location](http://www.derkholm.net/thomas/dazzle/)

Thanks
------

The [open-bio](http://www.open-bio.org/) servers reside in in a Tier 1
Boston area colocation facility. Infrastructure geeks can see pictures
of the colocation cage and the new OBF servers online at this URL:
[1](http://bioteam.net/gallery/bioteamBDC) -- those servers also host
EMBOSS FTP/CVS and mailing lists.

We would like to thank Chris Dagdigian from [The
Bioteam](http://www.bioteam.net/) for providing and maintaining the
bio\* servers.

Please see [documentation on customizing the
interface](http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_i18n) and the
[User's Guide](http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_User%27s_Guide)
for usage and configuration help.
