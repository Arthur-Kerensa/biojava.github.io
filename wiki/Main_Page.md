About BioJava
-------------

BioJava is an [open-source](wp:Open source "wikilink") project dedicated
to providing a [Java](http://www.java.sun.com) framework for processing
biological data. It include objects for manipulating biological
sequences, file parsers, [DAS](http://biodas.org/) client and server
support, access to [BioSQL](http://www.biosql.org/) and
[Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org) databases, tools for making sequence
analysis GUIs and powerful analysis and statistical routines including a
dynamic programming toolkit.

BioJava is used in several real-world [bioinformatics
applications](Project:BioJavaInside "wikilink") and has been used for
bioinformatics analysis in a number of [published
studies](Project:BioJavaInside "wikilink").

Getting BioJava
---------------

BioJava is distributed under the terms of the GNU [Lesser GPL
V2.1](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html). This
means that you can use the libraries without your software being forced

BioJava releases can be obtained from our
[download](Project:download "wikilink") area. Instructions for
installing the library, and building source releases, can be found on
the [Getting started](Project:GetStarted "wikilink") page.

You can also maintain an up-to-date view of BioJava using Subversion.
You can obtain an [anonymous checkout](CVS_to_SVN_Migration "wikilink")
of biojava or [browse the SVN
repository](http://code.open-bio.org/svnweb/index.cgi/biojava/browse/biojava-live/trunk).
Automated builds from the latest subversion checkouts are available from
<http://www.spice-3d.org/cruise/>

If you wish to contribute your existing code or help maintain part of
the BioJava code-base, then we can supply you with a read/write account.
Sign up for the [biojava-dev mailing
list](http://www.biojava.org/mailman/listinfo/biojava-dev) and post a
request for an account.

Bugs and Requests for enhancement
---------------------------------

BioJava probably contains the odd bug, who would have thought!! We make
use of the [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org) bug reporting and
tracking system. You can use it to
[submit](http://bugzilla.open-bio.org/) a new bug or request for
enhancement or to [view](http://bugzilla.open-bio.org/) open bugs or
known issues.

Documentation
-------------

### Cookbook

The biojava project maintains a [cookbook of
examples](BioJava:CookBook "wikilink") that help you perform common
tasks and get you started using biojava. The cookbook is affectionately
known as [Biojava in Anger](BioJava:CookBook "wikilink"). A [French
version](BioJava:CookbookFrench "wikilink") is also available.

### API Documentation (JavaDocs)

The following are links to API documentation autogenerated by javadoc.

### BioJava Tutorial

The BioJava tutorial is [here](BioJava:Tutorial "wikilink")

### BioJavaX Documentation

This documentation is just as much under development as the code it
refers to, so use with care. It is a rough guide rather than a detailed
description.

    format)](BioJava:BioJavaXDocs "wikilink")

### Dazzle

The [Dazzle](Dazzle "wikilink") DAS server repository and documentation
has been moved to a new
[location](http://www.derkholm.net/thomas/dazzle/)

Thanks
------

The [open-bio](http://www.open-bio.org/) servers reside in in a Tier 1
Boston area colocation facility. Infrastructure geeks can see pictures
of the colocation cage and the new OBF servers online at this URL:
[1](http://bioteam.net/gallery/bioteamBDC) -- those servers also host
EMBOSS FTP/CVS and mailing lists.

We would like to thank Chris Dagdigian from [The
Bioteam](http://www.bioteam.net/) for providing and maintaining the
bio\* servers.

Please see [documentation on customizing the
interface](http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_i18n) and the
[User's Guide](http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_User%27s_Guide)
for usage and configuration help.
