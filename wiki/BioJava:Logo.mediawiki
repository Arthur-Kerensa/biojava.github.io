== Logo Suggestions ==
BioJava Logo 1 
[[Image:bio-java-logo.gif]]   Nice but we cannot incorporate the Sun Java logo, that would need to change.




BioJava Logo 2

BioJava Logo 5
[[Image:bj-logo-5.gif]]    5, 6 and 7 are good but we would need to modify the cup so that we are not using the Sun Java logo.

Hi Mark and all. I would tend to go with the Zen look of the BioPerl logo. You are right about the cup as it is right now (deigns 5 to 7), it looks to much like Sun's. My original idea was to have a DNA helix swirl out of a steaming cup of hot cocoa ;-) Could we stylized the cup with 0 and 1, a,c,g,t ? --[[User:Foisys|Foisys]] 09:48, 7 February 2006 (EST)
