Converted entry.getValue() to string before submitting it to sendAlignmentRequest because it won't catch the DNASequence version.

Also, it keeps giving this error due to a bug in the biojava code: java.lang.Exception: ''The key named PROGRAM is not set in this RemoteQBlastOutputProperties object''

Hi,

Thanks for the input. I'll look into this ASAP.

HI,

Ok, here goes: 

Your first bug might be related to the fact that in my example code, you read a file with ProteinSequences in an array and ProteinSequence objects are what is expected here:

<code>
			for (Entry<String, ProteinSequence> entry : a.entrySet()) {
				System.out.println( entry.getValue().getOriginalHeader() + "\n");
				request = rbw.sendAlignmentRequest(entry.getValue(),rqb);
				rid.add(request);			}
</code>

If you are using DNASequences, you need to do this:

<code>			for (Entry<String, DNASequence> entry : a.entrySet()) {
				System.out.println( entry.getValue().getOriginalHeader() + "\n");
				request = rbw.sendAlignmentRequest(entry.getValue(),rqb);
				rid.add(request);			}
</code>

I can tell you this works a-ok :-)

The second thing is a bug in the code that I have now fixed in the biojava-live svn. Please give it a try and let me know if it works. It does for me...
