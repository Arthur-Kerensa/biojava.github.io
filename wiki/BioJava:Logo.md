BioJava Needs a Logo
--------------------

The new wiki site calls for a new BioJava logo. If you have ideas for a
new logo then upload your ideas here. As this will be a community
process feel free to make comments on this page about which logos you
prefer. --[Mark](User:Mark "wikilink") 21:28, 1 February 2006 (EST)

I am a total waste with a pencil but he is an idea: how about stylizing
the Sun's Java cup (with 0's anbd 1's?) and have the steam coming out as
a double helix? Anyone with some talent could prototype this?
