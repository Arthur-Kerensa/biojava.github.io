I've noticed some misprints in BioJavaX Documentation and in the source
code.

[Here](BioJava:BioJavaXDocs#Writing_2 "wikilink") in
[BioJavaXDocs](BioJava:BioJavaXDocs "wikilink") it is said that GenBank
Field FEATURE can be outputted as follows: "...For the source feature,
the db\_xref and organism fields are added to the output by calling
**getNCBITaxon().getNCBITaxID()** and
**getNCBITaxon().getDisplayName()** on the sequence (the latter is
chopped before the first bracket if necessary)...."
