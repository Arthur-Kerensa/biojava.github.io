I have tested the demos\seq\TestGenbank.java on my computer, but the results of the features are not as the same order as the original file. How could I get the features in the same order of the original file?

demos\seq\TestGenbank.java:
 
for(Iterator i = seq.features(); i.hasNext(); ) {
          Feature f = (Feature) i.next();
          System.out.println("\t" + f.getType() + "\t" + f.getLocation() + "\t" +               f.getAnnotation().asMap());
        }
