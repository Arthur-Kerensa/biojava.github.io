Follow these steps and start using BioJava with the
[NetBeans|<http://www.netbeans.org>] IDE (It works best for version 5.0
and greater)

1) Download the necessary .jar files,javadocs and source from the
Biojava download [area](BioJava:Download "wikilink").

2) Open a project in Netbeans (one that you will use biojava for) and go
to the Project Panel.

3) Right click the Library folder and choose add library.

4) Add the appropriate .jar files,javadocs and source codes and start
using them in your project.

NOTE: It is not mandatory to add the javadocs and source codes but
adding them provides help during coding.
