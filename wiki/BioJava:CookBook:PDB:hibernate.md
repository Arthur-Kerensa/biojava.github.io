How to serialize a protein structure to a database
--------------------------------------------------

There is a little project that provides
[Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org) mappings for the protein structure
classes at
[<http://www.spice-3d.org/hibernatePDB/>](http://www.spice-3d.org/hibernatePDB/).
It mainly consists of the Hibernate mappings files,with a few Java
helper classes.

I am not sure if this should be joint with the core BioJava
CVS. --[Andreas](User:Andreas "wikilink") 17:42, 8 October 2007 (EDT)
