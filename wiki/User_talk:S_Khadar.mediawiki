Dear BJ Buddies, 

I am Shameer Khadar (SK), I have Physics (BSc) and Computational Biology (MSc) background, presently playing around with protein sequence, structure, genome analysis, OpenSource programming for Web-based database and server development in Prof. Dr. R.Sowdhamini's Lab [http://caps.ncbs.res.in CAPS], The Computational Biology Group - NCBS [http://www.ncbs.res.in National Centre for Biological Sciences] - TIFR - B'Lore - India. I extensively used BioJava for teaching purpose for B.Tech, MSc and M.Tech students (Bioinformatics Major). Now, I am in the prep stage to develop an integrated tool using BJ (BioJava). --[[User:S Khadar|S Khadar]] 15:25, 6 February 2006 (EST)
