'''Amino Acids Physico-Chemical Properties Calculation'''

''[[Google Summer of Code]] Project by [[Chuan Hock Koh]]''

''Mentored by [[Peter Troshin]]''

''Co-mentored by Andreas Prlic''

The calculation of simple physico-chemical properties for biopolymers is an important tool in the arsenal of molecular biologist. Theoretically calculated quantities like extinction coefficients, isoelectric points, hydrophobicities and instability indices are useful guides as to how a molecule behaves in an experiment. Many tools for calculating these properties exist, including widely used open-source implementations in EMBOSS and BioPerl, but only some are currently available in BioJava3. The aim of this project is to port or produce new implementations of standard algorithms for a range of calculations within BioJava3.


==Timeline==

===Phase 1 (7 Weeks)===

''April 25 to June 12'' - Deliverables: APIs

* Research and finalize with mentor the properties to be included
* Start coding of APIs while writing the documentation concurrently

===Phase 2 (3 Weeks)===

''June 13 to July 3'' - Deliverables: Tested APIs and Documentations

* Write test cases to ensure accuracy of the APIs
* Clean up codes and documentation for readability
* Update BioJava wiki page and write tutorial for using APIs
* Check with mentor on areas of improvement

===Phase 3 (2 Weeks)===

''July 4 - July 17'' - Deliverables: Executable

* Develop, test and document command line executable for generating properties
* Update BioJava wiki page and write tutorial for using Executables

===Phase 4 (2 Weeks)===

''July 18 - July 31'' - Deliverables: SOAP web services

* Expose APIs as SOAP web services within the JABAWS framework
* Test and document the services

===Phase 5 (3 Weeks)===
 
"August 1 to August 21"

* Final touch-up based on mentorsâ€™ feedback

==Progress Log==

===April 26 - ===

* setup biojava3-alignment module
