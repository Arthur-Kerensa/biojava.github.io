== Reverse complement of DNA sequence ==

Read DNA sequence and write their reverse complement. This is based on the benchmark provided at:[http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=revcomp&lang=all http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=revcomp&lang=all] 

read line-by-line a redirected FASTA format file. 

for each sequence: write the id, description, and the reverse-complement sequence in FASTA format

== Calculate structure alignment of Myoglobin and Haemoglobin ==

Calculate a protein structure alignment for Myoglobin (PDB code: 2jho) and Haemoglobin (PDB code: 2hhb).
The matches to the 4 chains in Haemoglobin are identified as different alternate solutions.
