Regading BIOSQL files
---------------------

Dear all,

I have downloaded the BioSQL db files, viz:-

biosqldb-pg.sql biosqldb-assembly-pg.sql biosql-accelerators-pg.sql

When i am trying to compile the biosqldb-pg.sql file, it gives me a
error. stating that the following error.

![](C:\error.jpg "C:\error.jpg")

If any1 could tell me how to rectify these errors and work ahead, it
would be very nice.

Regards,

Sreejith
