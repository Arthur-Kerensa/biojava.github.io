=Maintainers wanted=

We are currently looking for maintainer(s) for the following sub-packages



==BLAST parsers==

The BioJava [[BioJava:CookBook:Blast:Parser|BLAST parser modules]] are among the most frequently used bits of BioJava.
It is possible to parse a large variety of BLAST-family output files, but the framework is not complete.
We are looking for a motivated individual who wants to take over the leadership over these modules, interact with a large 
user community and claim responsibility for maintaining and further developing these modules. 

Among the currently open tasks are:
 * add support for PSI-blast parsing
 * support parsing of result files with multiple queries
 * support XML-output parsing
 * refactor the blast packages to provide more understandable package names. (for Biojava-v3)
