BioJava In Anger - A Tutorial and Recipe Book for Those in a Hurry
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

BioJava can be both big and intimidating. For those of us who are in a
hurry there really is a whole lot there to get your head around. This
document is designed to help you develop BioJava programs that do 99% of
common tasks without needing to read and understand 99% of the BioJava
API.

The page was inspired by various programming cookbooks and follows a
"How do I...?" type approach. Each "How do I?" is linked to some example
code that does what you want and sometimes more. Basically if you find
the code you want and copy and paste it into your program you should be
up and running quickly. I have endeavoured to over document the code to
make it more obvious what I am doing so some of the code might look a
bit bloated.

'BioJava in Anger' is maintained by [Mark
Schreiber](User:Mark "wikilink"). If you have any suggestions, questions
or comments contact the [biojava mailing
list](mailto:biojava-l@biojava.org). To subscribe to this list go

These demos are tested with BioJava 1.3 and Java 1.4
