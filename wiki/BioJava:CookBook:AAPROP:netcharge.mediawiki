===How is Net Charge computed?===

The Net Charge of a protein sequence at a certain pH is computed using the following formulae.

In BioJava, the default pH used is 7.0. 

pKa values used can be chosen between the following two websites with ExPASy being the default one.

1) ExPASy - ProtParam [http://web.expasy.org/protparam/]

OR

2) Innovagen - [http://www.innovagen.se/custom-peptide-synthesis/peptide-property-calculator/peptide-property-calculator-notes.asp#PI].<br/>
Do note that the pKa values referenced by Innovagen are based on Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, Third Edition.<br/>
Currently in the process of updating to 4th Edition.<br/>
