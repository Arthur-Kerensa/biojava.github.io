WebCVS, CVS and Mailing list pages
----------------------------------

Is there really a need to move the CVS and mailing list pages into the
Wiki? These are special pages/interfaces to specific web applications. I
also think it would be a quite difficult job to do so. So my proposal is
to change nothing, instead just to link to it from the Wiki.
