===How is Instability Index computed?===

The instability index provides an estimate of the stability of proteins in a test tube. 
It is computed using the following formulae.

     where L is the length of sequence and DIWV is the instability weight value for the dipeptide starting in position i.

The DIWV value for dipeptides are based on this [http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/2/155.abstract paper].
