List rules
----------

-   Post in text format only. If you post in HTML or RTF the antispam
    software is likely to quarenteen your email for at least a week.
-   Don't attach files. They will also cause the spam filter to kick in.
    You will also cause problems to people with low bandwidth
    connections (some of us check this list on the road).
-   Don't flame. Keep it constructive. Pleasingly we have never had a
    flame war on the list, we would like to keep it that way.
-   Job vacancies can be posted but only if relevant to the list, i.e
    they should be aimed at bioinformatics or genomics java programmers.
    If you are not sure ask one of the [core team](Core Team "wikilink")
    first.
-   Never spam!
-   Off topic issues should be kept to a minimum. The subjectline should
    be pre-pended with [Off Topic] or similar
