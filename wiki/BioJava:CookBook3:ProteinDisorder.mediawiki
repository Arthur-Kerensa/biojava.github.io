==How can I predict disordered regions on the protein sequence?==

BioJava provide a module ''biojava3-protein-disorder'' for prediction disordered regions from protein sequence.

Biojava3-protein-disorder module for now contains one method for the prediction of disordered regions from protein sequence. This method is based on the Java implementation of [[http://www.strubi.ox.ac.uk/RONN||RONN]] predictor. 

This code has been originally developed for use with [[http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jabaws|JABAWS 2]]. We call this code  ''JRONN''. This code is based on the C implementation of RONN algorithm and uses the same model data, therefore gives the same predictions. Main motivation behind JRONN development was providing an implementation of RONN more suitable to use by the automated analysis pipelines and web services.  

Robert Esnouf has kindly allowed us to explore his code and share the results with the community. 

Original version of RONN is described in Yang,Z.R., Thomson,R., McMeil,P. and Esnouf,R.M. (2005) RONN: the bio-basis function neural network technique applied to the detection of natively disordered regions in proteins Bioinformatics 21: 3369-3376

==Example 1: Calculate the probability of disorder for every residue in the sequence ==
<java>
FastaSequence fsequence = new FastaSequence("name", "LLRGRHLMNGTMIMRPWNFLNDHHFPKFFPHLIEQQAIWLADWWRKKHC" +
				"RPLPTRAPTMDQWDHFALIQKHWTANLWFLTFPFNDKWGWIWFLKDWTPGSADQAQRACTWFFCHGHDTN");
float[]	rawProbabilityScores = Jronn.getDisorderScores(fsequence);
</java>

==Example 2: Calculate the probability of disorder for every residue in the sequence for all proteins from the FASTA input file ==
<java>
final List<FastaSequence> sequences = SequenceUtil.readFasta(new FileInputStream("src/test/resources/fasta.in"));
Map<FastaSequence, float[]> rawProbabilityScores = Jronn.getDisorderScores(sequences); 
</java>

==Example 3: Get the disordered regions of the protein for a single protein sequence ==
<java>
FastaSequence fsequence = new FastaSequence("Prot1", "LLRGRHLMNGTMIMRPWNFLNDHHFPKFFPHLIEQQAIWLADWWRKKHC" +
				"RPLPTRAPTMDQWDHFALIQKHWTANLWFLTFPFNDKWGWIWFLKDWTPGSADQAQRACTWFFCHGHDTN" +
				"CQIIFEGRNAPERADPMWTGGLNKHIIARGHFFQSNKFHFLERKFCEMAEIERPNFTCRTLDCQKFPWDDP");
Range[] ranges = Jronn.getDisorder(fsequence);
</java>

==Example 4: Calculate the disordered regions for the proteins from FASTA file ==
<java>
final List<FastaSequence> sequences = SequenceUtil.readFasta(new FileInputStream("src/test/resources/fasta.in"));
Map<FastaSequence, Range[]> ranges = Jronn.getDisorder(sequences);

</java>
