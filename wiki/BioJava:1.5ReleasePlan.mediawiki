=Release plan for BioJava 1.5=

===Background===
We would like to begin work on making a 1.5 release of BioJava. This will include all new developments such as the BioJavaX and structure APIs.

I propose we initially make a BioJava1.5 beta which will be a snapshot of CVS and will only contain the documentation, demos and unit tests at that date (not a complete and up to date suite). 

A full BioJava 1.5 final release will ideally contain fully updated documentation, demos, unit tests etc.
