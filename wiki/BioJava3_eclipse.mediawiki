Eclipse is a common IDE for using BioJava.

== Prerequisites ==

# Download Eclipse from [http://www.eclipse.org/ http://www.eclipse.org/]. Several flavors are available, which come with different pre-installed plugins. We recommend starting with 'Eclipse IDE for Java Developers'.
# Install the following plugins. See [[#Plugin Installation|Plugin Installation]] below for detailed instructions.
#* m2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse
#* Eclipse EGit
#* m2e-egit SCM Handler

== Cloning the repository ==

We recommend [[Contributing to BioJava#Forking Biojava|creating a fork]] on github for day-to-day development. In the following instructions you should substitute something like 'https://github.com/<username>/biojava.git' for the repository URL. If you don't want to make a fork (for instance, if you don't plan to make any changes), you can follow the instructions below exactly.

''TODO: write instructions''

== Plugin Installation ==

''This section needs to be expanded with specific instructions for installing plugins using either Marketplace or directly from the Install software menu.''

Recent versions of Eclipse come with the Marketplace plugin, which can be used to find and install additional plugins. Feel free to install the prerequisites from Marketplace. This tutorial uses the older method of installing plugins directly from their repositories, which is compatible with more versions of Eclipse.

=== 1. Install Maven m2e ===
[[File:Install_m2e.png|thumb|300px|Screenshot of Install New Software dialog after selecting m2e for install.]]
# In eclipse, go to {{menu2|Help|Install New Software...}}
# Choose '--All Available Sites--' from the 'Work with' dropdown
# Search for 'm2e' and check the box next to 'm2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse' under Collaboration
# Click 'Next', accept the license, and finish the installation
# Restart Eclipse at the prompt

If everything went smoothly, after reboot the 'Welcome' screen should mention 'Maven Integration for Eclipse'.

=== 2. Install EGit ===
Installing egit is very similar to installing m2e.

# In eclipse, go to {{menu2|Help|Install New Software...}}
# Choose '--All Available Sites--' from the 'Work with' dropdown
# Search for 'egit' and check the box next to 'Eclipse EGit' under Collaboration
# Click 'Next', accept the license, and finish the installation
# Restart Eclipse at the prompt

After rebooting, the Welcome screen should have a section about Git.

=== 3. Install the SCM Handler ===
[[File:EGit SCM install 1.png|thumb|300px|The {{menu|Import...}} dialog. [[#3. Install the SCM Handler|Step 1]]]]
[[File:EGit SCM install 2.png|thumb|300px|Link to the m2e Marketplace, without any SCM connectors installed. [[#3. Install the SCM Handler|Step 3]]]]
[[File:EGit SCM install 3.png|thumb|300px|Installing m2e-egit from the m2e Marketplace [[#3. Install the SCM Handler|Step 4]]]]
# Go to {{menu2|File|Import...}}
# In the Maven category, select 'Check out Maven Projects from SCM' and click Next
# At this point, the Git connector is not installed, so the 'SCM URL' dropdown will either be blank or will only contain other SCM connectors like SVN. Click 'Find more SCM connectors in the m2e Marketplace'
# Search for 'egit' in the 'Install m2e connectors' dialog. Check the 'm2e-egit' connector and click Finish.
# Click through the installer dialog and license. The security warning about unsigned content is safe to ignore.
# Restart eclipse (last time!)

Eclipse should now be ready to get the latest checkout of BioJava. See [[#Cloning the repository|Cloning the repository]] above.
