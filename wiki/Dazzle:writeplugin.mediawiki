=How to write your own Dazzle plugin=


Each Dazzle plugin has to implement several interfaces.
Here we will show how to implement a Dazzle plugin that supports the DAS - features command:

The Interface that needs to be implemented is the [http://www.derkholm.net/svn/repos/dazzle/trunk/src/org/biojava/servlets/dazzle/datasource/GFFFeatureSource.java GFFFeatureSource] interface.

What this means is that the DAS source provides a method called

 getFeatures(String reference)

that returns an array of [http://www.derkholm.net/svn/repos/dazzle/trunk/src/org/biojava/servlets/dazzle/datasource/GFFFeature.java GFFFeature.java] objects that contain the data that should be transported.
