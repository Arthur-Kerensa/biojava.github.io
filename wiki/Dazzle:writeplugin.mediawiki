=How to write your own Dazzle plugin=


Each Dazzle plugin has to implement certain interfaces.
Here we will show how to implement a Dazzle plugin that supports the DAS - features command, using the GFFFeatureSource interface. There are also other plugin mechanisms in Dazzle, but for the moment let's only consider this one.

The Interface that needs to be implemented is the [http://www.derkholm.net/svn/repos/dazzle/trunk/src/org/biojava/servlets/dazzle/datasource/GFFFeatureSource.java GFFFeatureSource] interface.

What this means is that the DAS source provides a method called

 GFFFeature getFeatures(String reference);

This method accepts a String as an argument, that represents either the chromosomal region or the accession code that is requested. It returns an array of [http://www.derkholm.net/svn/repos/dazzle/trunk/src/org/biojava/servlets/dazzle/datasource/GFFFeature.java GFFFeature] objects that contain the data that should be transported.
