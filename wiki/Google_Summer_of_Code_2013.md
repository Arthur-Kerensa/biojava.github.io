BioJava at GSoC Introduction
----------------------------

Google has not announced yet if there will be a Google Summer of Code
2013. This page is in preparation in case GSoC will happen again this
year.

If you want to propose a project, have a look at the <BioJava:Modules>
page, for areas which are currently under development. Also take a look
at the [Feature Requests](BioJava3_Feature_Requests "wikilink") page.
There are also some ideas from last year at
[Google\_Summer\_of\_Code\_2012](Google_Summer_of_Code_2012 "wikilink")

Please read the [GSoC page at the Open Bioinformatics
Foundation](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code) and the
[main Google Summer of Code page](http://code.google.com/soc) for more
details about the program.
