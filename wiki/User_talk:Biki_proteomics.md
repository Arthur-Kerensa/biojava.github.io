Hi,

I think that this is best answer in the Discussion section. Have you
tried the instructions found [here](BioJava:GetStarted "wikilink")? It
all depends on your OS but the end point is making sure that the JRE can
find the JAR files. In my case (Mac OS X), the external libraries for
Java live in /Library/Java/Extensions, only accessible using sudo or
root access. You can of course write your own $CLASSPATH instead ;-).

Best regards

Sylvain
