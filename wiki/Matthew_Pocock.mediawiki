Matthew is a co-founder of Biojava, and has developed (with [[Thomas Down|Thomas Down]]) much of the Biojava library. He has completed a PhD in bioinformatics at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute/ Cambridge University. His PhD centered on the problems faced when analysing data-sets generated from genomic research. Existing methods did not scale gracefully with the vast quantity of information. He developed ways of analysing these very large data sets and also software capable of representing genomic data efficiently. Matthew is now at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, investigating ways that existing scalable solutions, such as Biojava, can be leveraged through web service and grid technologies for life sciences.
