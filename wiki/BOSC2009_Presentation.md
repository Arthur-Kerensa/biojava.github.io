BioJava at BOSC/ISMB 2009
-------------------------

Hi,

I would like to submit an abstract to BOSC 2009 for BioJava and organize
a BioJava user meeting around ISMB. This page will be used to prepare
this. --[Andreas](User:Andreas "wikilink") 00:35, 18 March 2009 (UTC)

Abstract
--------

### BioJava 2009: an Open-Source Framework for Bioinformatics

BioJava is a mature open-source project that provides a framework for
processing of biological data. BioJava contains powerful analysis and
statistical routines, tools for parsing common file formats, and
packages for manipulating sequences and 3D structures. It enables rapid
bioinformatics application development in the Java programming language.

BioJava is available freely under the terms of version 2.1 of the GNU
Lesser General Public License (LGPL) from <http://biojava.org/>. Here we
present the latest BioJava release (version 1.7, released in Apr 2009)

Besides numerous bug fixes and stability improvements, a lot of
development has been going on in the protein structure modules. BioJava
now provides a framework for parsing mmCif files. The parsing of PDB
header information has been improved and a new tool to read the Chemical
component dictionary is in place.

An ongoing project is the open sourcing of the RCSB protein structure
viewers. These have been made available as open source as a stand-alone
project. Work is currently under way to provide a more close integration
with BioJava

The BioJava website is <http://biojava.org/>. The version 1.7 release
can be downloaded from ...
