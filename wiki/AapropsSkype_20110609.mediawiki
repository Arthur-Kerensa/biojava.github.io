==Participants:==

Ah Fu, Peter, Andreas 


== Junit tests ==

last week not all tests passed,that's fixed. Also testing of extreme values was added. 

Peter: don't catch (expected) exceptions in junit tests, use annotations instead.
 
rounding: probably the best approach is to use String.format() or DecimalFormat.

== XML parsing ==

some difficulties: What is the best approach about doing this?

- first approach was use XMLspy to generate Schema from XML file.

- Peter: better to create the class first and then auto-generate XML from that.

- Start with a new elements class that captures the elements in the periodic table 

- Use Jaxb to export to XML

- Create loader  

- later add a compound class

- make sure to add side-chains to amino acids

Peter will send out an example of how he thinks this should be done

== Outlook for this week ==

 - XML representation of Elements

 - finish up junit tests
