datastructures to store local alignments. Started with data structures

### Problem with Eclipse

Sometimes the substitution matrices can't be found from resource folder.
Is it a Maven eclipse issue?

### Test Coverage

Tried the CodeCover eclipse plugin but there were some issues with it.
Would be nice to be able to see how complete the tests are.

### Cruisecontrol

Running now at

### Github

Kyle: We have a first fork. Andy Yates patched some issues on a branch.
Need to make sure the patches are merged back correctly.

Outlook for next week
