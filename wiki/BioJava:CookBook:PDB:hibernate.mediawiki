==How to serialize a protein structure to a database==

There is a little project that provides [http://www.hibernate.org Hibernate] mappings for the protein structure classes at [http://www.spice-3d.org/hibernatePDB/ http://www.spice-3d.org/hibernatePDB/]. It mainly consists of the Hibernate mappings files,with a few Java helper classes.

I am not sure if this should be joint with the core BioJava CVS.
