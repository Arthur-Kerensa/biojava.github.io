### dbSNP objects for BioJava

I started working with a research team focusing in genomics and observed
that there is nothing in BioJava to deal with dbSNP infos. I setup a
(very) simple NCBIdbSNP class that can fetch single dbSNP entries and
represent them as RichSequences. Anybody would have insights o nthe
subject where I could go with this?
