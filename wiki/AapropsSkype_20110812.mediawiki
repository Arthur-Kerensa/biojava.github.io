= Overview, where are we = 

overview over new modules: 
 - protein disorder
 - amino acid properties
 -- molecular weight
 -- exctinction coefficient
 -- isoelectric points
 --  several others
 -- available as executable jar file 

= Molecular Weight calculations =


= Overview of last year's summer of code project re. Protein Modifications
 - Resid
 - PSI-MOD ontology (combination of resid and another db called delta-mass) collects differences in mass for every protein modification

 - we created an XML file that describes protein modifications in he PDB. Cross references to Resid and PSI-MOD. If there is ag a phosphorylated serin, it describes what atoms are connected.
 - Student last year wrote a program that would take a PDB file, scan through it and detect all modifications that are there.
 - used on the PDB web site to visualize the results.

Short demo of PSI-MOD. We could use the IDs for the modification to exactly identify what is the modification and what is the mass.

-- documentation, where are so far?

next Skype call is on Wednesday 18th of August
