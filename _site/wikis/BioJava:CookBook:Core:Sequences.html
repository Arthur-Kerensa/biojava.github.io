<p>is is fairly straightforward to create sequences. Take a look at these
examples:</p>

<p>Sequence objects can be created by providing a string representation as
an input to the constructor:</p>

<java> ProteinSequence seq = new
ProteinSequence("MSTNPKPQRKTKRNTNRRPQDVKFPGG"); </java>

<p>Fetch a protein sequence based on a UniProt accession code from UniProt.</p>
<java> String uniProtID = "P26663";

// we will tell the UniProt proxy class that we are expecting a sequence
that is an amino acid AminoAcidCompoundSet set =
AminoAcidCompoundSet.getAminoAcidCompoundSet();

// now load the sequence from the UniProt website
UniprotProxySequenceReader<aminoacidcompound> uniprotSequence = new
UniprotProxySequenceReader<aminoacidcompound>(uniProtID,set);

// and make a protein sequence out of it ProteinSequence seq = new
ProteinSequence(uniprotSequence); 
</aminoacidcompound></aminoacidcompound></java>
