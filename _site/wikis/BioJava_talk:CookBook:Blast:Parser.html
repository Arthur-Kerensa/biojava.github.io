<p>Code here didn’t work for me (tested windows and linux blast, many
output formats), but using the code under
demobs/blastxml/BlastParser.java did work… also found several hits on
google of other people having the same issue. Consider replacing/adding
that here?-<a href="User:Oneplus999" title="wikilink">Oneplus999</a></p>

<p>I recommend either posting the exact nature of the problem to the
mailing list, or if you fixed the problem, would be great if you could
create a new page for your solution and hook it up with the cookbook.
