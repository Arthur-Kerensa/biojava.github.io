<h2 id="report-from-last-week">Report from last week:</h2>

<p>Mark: last week added global pairwise alignments, added a parallell
version. Guide tree building. Committed: concurrency tools, common
interface to a shared thread pool. A few interface classes return future
objects.</p>

<p>implemented in alignments, which is a static utility class</p>

<p>yesterday: added support for alternate scores</p>

<p>Andreas: We should use an example so one can easily trace how far the
module is at the present. Use piwi family as an example.</p>

<p>Would be easier to work with the forester library if we would have also
a source-jar. Will ask Scooter if he can provide a copy of the jar with
sources attached.</p>

<h2 id="outlook-for-this-week">Outlook for this week</h2>

<p>basic progressive alignment profile - profile aligner use tree to build
up larger and larger profiles from individual sequences</p>

<p>things missing: getting local alignments done. SM</p>

<p>examples for users.</p>

<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>

<p>Andreas: automated build is not ready yet (problems when running it on
the production server)</p>

<p>released the RCSB PDB sequence code as a new project in biojava-svn</p>

<p>Kyle: will add it to github</p>

<p>Mark: @override annotation - differences between Java 1.5 and Java 1.6</p>
