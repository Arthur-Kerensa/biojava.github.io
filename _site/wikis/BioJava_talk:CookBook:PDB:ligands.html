<p>Hi,</p>

<p>Thanks for the example but could you add a title of what this is
supposed to be doing and some extra material to put this code in
context? The target audience of this cookbook is the programmer novice
to BioJava and this would be added value to your code example.</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p>
