<p>BioJava provide a module <em>biojava-protein-disorder</em> for prediction
disordered regions from a protein sequence. Biojava-protein-disorder
module for now contains one method for the prediction of disordered
regions. This method is based on the Java implementation of
<a href="http://www.strubi.ox.ac.uk/RONN">RONN</a> predictor.</p>

<p>This code has been originally developed for use with
<a href="http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jabaws">JABAWS</a>. We call this code
<em>JRONN</em>. <em>JRONN</em> is based on the C implementation of RONN algorithm and
uses the same model data, therefore gives the same predictions. JRONN
based on RONN version 3.1 which is still current in time of writing
(August 2011). Main motivation behind JRONN development was providing an
implementation of RONN more suitable to use by the automated analysis
pipelines and web services. Robert Esnouf has kindly allowed us to
explore the RONN code and share the results with the community.</p>

<p>Original version of RONN is described in <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/16/3369.full">Yang,Z.R., Thomson,R.,
McMeil,P. and Esnouf,R.M. (2005) RONN: the bio-basis function neural
network technique applied to the detection of natively disordered
regions in proteins. Bioinformatics 21:
3369-3376</a></p>

<p>Examples of use are provided below. For more information please refer to
JronnExample testcases.</p>

<p>Finally instead of an API calls you can use a <a href="BioJava:CookBook3:ProteinDisorderCLI" title="wikilink"> command line
utility</a>, which is
likely to give you a better performance as it uses multiple threads to
perform calculations.</p>
