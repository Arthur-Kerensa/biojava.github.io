<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>BioJava will run on any computer with a Java virtual machine complying
to the Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE) 1.6 (or later) specifications.
Java implementations for Linux, Windows, and Solaris are available to
download from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/">Oracle’s java
website</a>. Recent versions of
MacOS X include a suitable Java implementation as standard. Java is also
available on many other platforms: if in doubt, contact your vendor.
BioJava binaries are distributed in .jar (Java ARchive) format.</p>

<p>You can get the latest version of BioJava3+ from the download page
<a href="Biojava:Download" title="wikilink">BioJava (v) (requires Java 1.6+)</a>.</p>

<p>You can get the latest version of BioJava-legacy (a.k.a. BioJava1) from
the download page <a href="Biojava:Download_" title="wikilink">BioJava1 (v) (requires Java
1.5+)</a>.</p>

<p>You can also integrate BioJava with NetBeans IDE. To find out how follow
this <a href="How_to_integrate_BioJava_in_NetBeans_IDE" title="wikilink">link</a>.</p>

<p>A step by step guide on ‘How to integrate BioJava in Netbeans IDE’ is

<h2 id="maven">Maven</h2>

<p>BioJava uses <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> as a build and
distribution system. If you are new to Maven, take a look at the
<a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html">Getting Started with
Maven</a> guide.</p>

<p>BioJava, as of release 4.0.0 is available through Maven Central.</p>

<p>You can add the BioJava repository by adding the following XML to your
project pom.xml file:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>        &lt;dependencies&gt;
                ...
                &lt;dependency&gt;
                        &lt;groupId&gt;org.biojava&lt;/groupId&gt;
                        &lt;artifactId&gt;biojava-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                        &lt;version&gt;4.2.0&lt;/version&gt;
                &lt;/dependency&gt;
                &lt;!-- other biojava jars as needed --&gt;
        &lt;/dependencies&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>None of these .jar files need to be unpacked for normal use – simply
place them in a convenient directory.</p>

<p>To use BioJava, add the required JAR files to your CLASSPATH environment
variable. The exact syntax varies between platforms.</p>

<p>It is also possible to “install” JAR files onto your system by copying
them into your Java installation’s extensions directory. On most Unix
systems, this is named <em>${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/ext</em>. On Mac OS X there is
a per-user extensions directory called <em>~/Library/Java/Extensions</em> (you
may have to create this directory yourself). For other platforms,
consult your Java vendor.</p>

<p>You can now compile and run BioJava programs using the <em>javac</em> and
<em>java</em> commands. You might like to look at the developer section on the
<a href="http://www.biojava.org/wiki/Main_Page">Main page</a> for documentation,
cookbook and tutorials. Finally, you can learn a lot about BioJava by
trying the demo programs included in the source distribution (see
below).</p>

<h2 id="building-your-own">Building your own</h2>

<p>If you want to modify BioJava, you can obtain a copy of the source code
from the download areas. Source releases are distributed in .tar.gz
format. You can also obtain up-to-the-minute source code via either the
<a href="http://biojava.org/download/maven/">Maven repository</a> or from
<a href="Get source" title="wikilink">github</a>.</p>

<p>BioJava is now built using <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven</a>.</p>
