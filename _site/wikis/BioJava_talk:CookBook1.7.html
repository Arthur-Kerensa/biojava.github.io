<p>Why dont we give a list of publications ? I think we should give pdf
link of the publications from personal pages of the authours – –<a href="User:S Khadar" title="wikilink">S

<p>Hi - I moved your entry in the Discussion section since it might
generate comments that are outside the scope of the CookBook. Actually
your idea is quite interesting. Why not make a page with some of the
papers that were created using BioJava and come back to the Cookbook
page and add the link? –<a href="User:Foisys" title="wikilink">Foisys</a> 15:19, 6

<p>Hi - I’ve searched for anything about this and found the followings:</p>

<p>Hi- That’s the link that I have put in the french version:
<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=biojava&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=biojava&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en</a>.
My suggestion is to create a page where some representative apps created
using BioJava could be showcased. –<a href="User:Foisys" title="wikilink">Foisys</a>

<p>What do people think about the links to STRAP here? this are links out
to their web site. No content in this wiki is provided and it does not
feel like the BioJava cookbook page is the right place for this. Perhaps
this should better be moved to the <a href="BioJava:BioJavaInside" title="wikilink">applications that are based on
biojava
page</a>? –<a href="User:Andreas" title="wikilink">Andreas</a>

<p>Hi gang ;-) Andreas has a good point. The goals of the cookbook is to
show people how to use BioJava to create their own solutions. STRAP is
good stuff but it goes beyond BioJava and stands on its own. I vote yea
on this. –<a href="User:Foisys" title="wikilink">Foisys</a> 11:50, 23 January 2008 (EST)</p>

<p>Ok, I moved the link to Strap to the <biojava:biojavainside> page, which
lists Applications that are based on BioJava and references scientific
articles. If you want to provide a link to your BioJava based tool,
please do it there. --[Andreas](User:Andreas "wikilink") 13:51, 24

<h3 id="links-to-javadoc">Links to Javadoc</h3>

<p>Another point: I saw that Andreas has added links to the javadocs on
some cookbook examples. I have not modified the french version yet but I
think that this is a good thing for all pages. Should we make this SOP
for cookbook recipes? I volunteer for the french cookbook but I would
appreciate some help if I dive into the english
version… –<a href="User:Foisys" title="wikilink">Foisys</a> 10:45, 23 January 2008

<p>Only thing that worries me is that if we have a new release of biojava,
the javadoc location changes. I just created a symbolic link on the web
server. from now on
<a href="http://www.biojava.org/docs/api/"><a href="http://www.biojava.org/docs/api/">http://www.biojava.org/docs/api/</a></a>
will always point to the latest version of the BioJava api, so all wiki
links should use that rather than
…/docs/api16/ –<a href="User:Andreas" title="wikilink">Andreas</a> 10:50, 23 January

<p>Good point ;-). I’ll start using this from now
on. –<a href="User:Foisys" title="wikilink">Foisys</a> 11:50, 23 January 2008 (EST)</p>

<h3 id="cookbook-sop">Cookbook SOP</h3>

<p>While we are at it, should we start thinking about a SOP for writing
recipes? I know that I have tried to stick to a common style for the
french version (like classes in italic) but it would be nice if we
worked toward some kind of
standard… –<a href="User:Foisys" title="wikilink">Foisys</a> 11:50, 23 January 2008
