<p>The isoelectric point, pI, is the pH at which the net charge of the
peptide is zero. We first computes the net charge for pH 7.0.<br />
If the charge is &gt; 0, the next pH to check is 7 + 3.5.<br />
If the charge is &lt; 0 then pH 7 - 3.5 is checked.<br />
This is repeated, using increments/decrements half the size of the
previous, until the modulus of the charge found is less than or equal to
0.0001.<br />
 pKa values used can be chosen between the following two sources with
ExPASy being the default one.</p>

<p>1) ExPASy - ProtParam <a href="http://web.expasy.org/protparam/">1</a></p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>2) A.Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry, 4th Edition (2005), Chapter
3, page 78, Table 3-1.
