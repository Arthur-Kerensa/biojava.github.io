<p>We would be interested in having Java ports of the following algorithms:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">- Blast</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">- Hmmer3</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">- Dssp (some parts already available)</code></p>

It won’t do perfect code but will get you close.</p>

<p>This is also an interesting approach <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cibyl/">http://code.google.com/p/cibyl/</a>
where I can’t imagine would work in a I/O or computationally intensive
application. Converting ASM to Bytecode takes out all the parsing
headaches. The JIT should still be able to take over and optimize.</p>

<p>I have used this before and works reasonably well.

maps all the ansi C libraries.</p>
