<h2 id="where-are-we">Where are we</h2>

<p>Generate XML - problems generating the Schema automatically. Some parts
seem to be missing. Peter: works ok for me, try to run as Junit test,
that will generate it. Ah Fu: problem with spaces in file path. After
some fiddling around, we could fix the issue. Next step: modify schema
and be as restrictive as possible.</p>

<h2 id="organisation-of-serialized-xml-files">Organisation of serialized XML files</h2>

<p>move files into resources folder.</p>

<p>things related to tests should be in src/tests/</p>

<p>things related to production use should be in src/main/java/</p>

<h2 id="outlook-for-the-week">Outlook for the week</h2>

<p>Start writing the tutorial, what the API can do.</p>

<p>Continue on requirements from last week, Compound needs more work. How
to deal with isotopes, test with an example. Also: XML needs to be
simplified to be more user friendly. Have a method that provides the
element file and only if users want to define their own switch to that
one.</p>
