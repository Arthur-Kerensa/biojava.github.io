<p>The aliphatic index of a protein is defined as the relative volume
occupied by aliphatic side chains (alanine, valine, isoleucine, and
leucine).<br />
It may be regarded as a positive factor for the increase of
thermostability of globular proteins.</p>

<p>Aliphatic index = ( (Ala count) + a * (Val count) + b * (Ile count) +
b * (Leu count) ) * 100 where a = 2.9 and b = 3.9<br />
