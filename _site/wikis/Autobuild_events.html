<h2 id="download-latest-automated-builds-for-biojava">Download latest automated builds for BioJava</h2>

<p>BioJava developers frequently fix bugs or add new features in the
<a href="CVS_to_SVN_Migration" title="wikilink">BioJava SVN repository</a>. You can
either obtain an <a href="CVS_to_SVN_Migration" title="wikilink">anonymous SVN
checkout</a> or download an automated
build based on the latest SVN content.</p>

<p>The automated builds make sure that the source code repository at all
times compiles fine and all JUnit tests are passed correctly. If this is
the case, a Maven based SNAPSHOT build of all biojava modules is created
and automatically provided for download at the BioJava Maven repository.
Note: Snapshot builds are based on the latest source code checkout which
might contain experimental or alpha-release source code. If you are
interested in using the current stable release, please obtain a download
from <biojava:download> instead.</biojava:download></p>
