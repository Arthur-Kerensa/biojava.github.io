<p>I was born in <a href="wp:Laguna (Santa Catarina)" title="wikilink">Laguna</a> but now I
live in Tubarão, <a href="wp:Santa Catarina (state)" title="wikilink">Santa Catarina</a>,
<a href="wp:Brazil" title="wikilink">Brazil</a> and work in
<a href="http://www.unisul.br">UNISUL</a> - a local University of <a href="wp:Santa Catarina (state)" title="wikilink">Santa

<p>I’ve contributed with BioJava by porting the
<a href="Biojava:Cookbook" title="wikilink">CookBook’s</a> English version to this Wiki,
but I’ve introduced to BioJava at 2005, when I’ve started my Bacharel’s
thesis using it how a framework to contruct <a href="wp:Phylogenetic trees" title="wikilink">Phylogenetic
trees</a> “powered by” <a href="wp:Genetic algorithms" title="wikilink">Genetic

I’ll presents my tesis at July of 2006… good luck for me.. “:)</p>

<p><strong>Title</strong>: Constructing phylogenetics trees from DNA sequences using
Genetic Algorithms, using a Web interface</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: <em>A common process in Phylogenetic Systematics is the
construction of cladograms - also known as Phylogenetic trees -, which
represent the relation of similarity between the studied species, based
on different criteria of evaluation. So, nowadays the use of
computational tools is very common to consider the DNA sequences as an
evaluation criteria, to return a set of consistent information, based on
systematic methods that make use of mathematical resources in order to
express relations between species in a model. This research demonstrates
how was possible to develop a genetic algorithm with a BLOSUM62
substitution matrix to obtain satisfactory results represented in a
phylogenetic tree, expressing similarity relations between the input
sequences.</em></p>
