<p>A suggestion: modifiying this to be like BioPerl. Not to be sheepish but
users going from one to the other would navigate easier. I would do it
but it seems that the page is
locked… –<a href="User:Foisys" title="wikilink">Foisys</a> 13:37, 6 February 2006

<p>Sylvain - I made you a sysop/Bureaucrat (just what you’ve always
wanted!) so you can edit the sidebar and generally wreak havoc in french
and english. –<a href="User:Jason" title="wikilink">Jason</a> 14:15, 6 February 2006

<p>I suggest an entry linking to the page BioJava:Download.</p>

<h2 id="editing-the-sidebar">Editing the Sidebar</h2>

<p>I have found that after editing the sidebar you sometimes need to log
out to actually see the changes you made when you return to the main
page. This might be an Internet Explorer specific
thing. –<a href="User:Mark" title="wikilink">Mark</a> 21:55, 7 February 2006 (EST)</p>

<p>I think it is a problem of the MediaWiki, e.g. if you edit a page (e.g.
just make a dummy edit, insert a whitespace) the sidebar gets updated on
this page. I had the same experiences with Firefox –

<p>Usually a forced reload will work or if you add ?action=purge to the end
of the URL it should re-generate it for
you. –<a href="User:Jason" title="wikilink">Jason</a> 07:56, 8 February 2006 (EST)</p>
