<p>Matthew is a co-founder of Biojava, and has developed (with <a href="Thomas Down" title="wikilink">Thomas
Down</a>) much of the Biojava library. He has
completed a PhD in bioinformatics at the Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute/ Cambridge University. His PhD centered on the problems faced
when analysing data-sets generated from genomic research. Existing
methods did not scale gracefully with the vast quantity of information.
He developed ways of analysing these very large data sets and also
software capable of representing genomic data efficiently. Matthew is
now at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, investigating ways that
existing scalable solutions, such as Biojava, can be leveraged through
web service and grid technologies for life sciences.</p>
