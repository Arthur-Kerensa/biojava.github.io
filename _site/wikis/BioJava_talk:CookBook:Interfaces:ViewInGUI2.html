<p>Hi Jolyon,</p>

<p>Thanks for this fine example ;-) Would it be possible to add some
material explaining how it does what it does? You have to remember that
the Cookbook is the main point of entry for the novice BioJava user and
some contextual informations is always welcome. Would you mind if I go
over the code and add extra comments to guide the users?</p>

<p>Best regards</p>

<p>Sylvain</p>

<p>Hi Sylvain,</p>

<p>I can add some material but I wouldn’t mind at all if you added extra
comments.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Jolyon</p>
