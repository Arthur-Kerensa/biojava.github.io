<h2 id="about-rcsb-viewers">About RCSB Viewers</h2>

<p>The <em>RCSB Viewers</em> suite of frameworks provides the capability of
creating 3-d viewing applications. The libraries are Java based, and
rely on <em>JOGL</em> (Java <em>OpenGL</em>) to do the 3d rendering. Currently, there
are four supported viewers implemented over the suite (see below.)</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The <em>RCSB Viewers</em> were initially implemented as a set of viewers over
the <em>MBT (Molecular Biology Toolkit) Library</em>, developed at the San
Diego Super Computing Center. The <em>MBT Library</em> provided the base-level
support for structure definition, loading, and viewing.</p>

<p>Since then, as part of a major re-architecting effort, the visualization
and application functionality have been lifted out of the <em>MBT Library</em>,
with a view towards replacing it with <em>BioJava</em>. As a result, the <em>MBT
Library</em> (renamed and factored in this distribution as the <em>RCSB MBT
Libs</em>) has been reduced to simply the structure definition and loading
frameworks - the UI application and 3d visualization frameworks have
been factored into discrete projects.</p>

<h2 id="current-viewers">Current Viewers</h2>

<p>The current set of viewers that are based on the framework are as
follows:</p>

<h4 id="rcsb-simple-viewer">RCSB Simple Viewer</h4>

<p>A basic viewer with no UI, except a menubar that allows for loading of
files and saving the current image to a file.</p>

<p><img src="SimpleViewerOverview.png" alt="" title="fig:SimpleViewerOverview.png" /></p>

<h4 id="rcsb-protein-workshop">RCSB Protein Workshop</h4>

<p>A viewer that provides tools to manipulate and examine parts of the
structure, as well as change the rendering styles.</p>

<p><img src="ProteinWorkshopOverview.png" alt="" title="fig:ProteinWorkshopOverview.png" /></p>

<h4 id="rcsb-ligand-explorer">RCSB Ligand Explorer</h4>

<p>This viewer explores relationships between ligands (or other non-protein
chains/residues) and the containing protein.</p>

<p><img src="LigandExplorerOverview.png" alt="" title="fig:LigandExplorerOverview.png" /></p>

<h4 id="rcsb-pdb-kiosk">RCSB PDB Kiosk</h4>

<p>The <em>Kiosk</em> viewer is a full screen viewer that provides a slide show of
a set of structures, smoothly animating the camera for each structure
shown to view it from different angles and perspectives. It can also
focus on non-protein chains/residues, if present in the molecule.</p>

<h2 id="current-projects">Current Projects</h2>

<p>The current primary projects defined for the <em>RCSB Viewers</em> are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RCSB MBT Libs<br />
this project contains the modules to define and carry the ‘model’,
defined as a set of structures. It has been mostly preserved directly
from the original <em>MBT Library</em> project. It also contains modules to
load files (currently only PDB and XML files are supported.) It is
expected this will be replaced by <em>BioJava</em>.</p>

  <!-- -->

  <p>RCSB UIApp Framework<br />
this project contains modules required to make an actual UI
(windowing) application. It defines a singleton application class,
mainframe (document frame) class, various controllers to tie the
pieces together and direct program flow. The UI aspect is based on
<em>Swing.</em></p>

  <!-- -->

  <p>RCSB Viewer Framework<br />
this is the project that carries the 3d modules and derived/modified
classes to enable creation of 3d applications. The 3d rendering is
provided by <em>JOGL (Java OpenGL)</em>, directly.</p>

  <!-- -->

  <p>RCSB Simple Viewer, RCSB Protein Workshop, RCSB Ligand Explorer, RCSB PDB Kiosk<br />
projects for the end viewer applications.</p>

  <p>In addition, there are several minor projects for updating datasets,
documentation, and tests. See the SVN repository for further
information.</p>

<p><em>Javadoc</em> documentation is generated from all the sources, and is
