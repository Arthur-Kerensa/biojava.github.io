<p>My career in bioinformatics started at
<a href="http://www.agresearch.co.nz/">AgResearch</a> in New Zealand, then moving
to the <a href="http://www.gis.a-star.edu.sg/">Genome Institute of Singapore</a>.</p>

<p>I used BioJava for a while but got seriously involved after working with
<a href="User:Mark" title="wikilink">Mark Schreiber</a> on the
<a href="http://www.dengueinfo.org/">DengueInfo</a> project in Singapore, which
required BioJava to be able to work seamlessly with
<a href="http://biosql.org/">BioSQL</a> databases. As this was not completely
possible in version 1.4, we produced the BioJavaX extensions released in
version 1.5 that allow BioJava to use the Hibernate framework for
accessing BioSQL.</p>

<p>I spent the next couple of years after Singapore working at the
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EBI</a> at Hinxton on the
<a href="http://www.biomart.org">BioMart</a> team. In Summer 2007 I mentored a
student for the Google Summer of Code, Boh-Yun Lee, who worked on some
phyloinformatics modules for us. The GSoCâ€™07 project was organised by
<a href="http://www.nescent.org/">NESCent</a>.</p>

<p>I am now self-employed as part of a new biotech startup in Cambridge,
<a href="http://www.eaglegenomics.com/">Eagle Genomics</a>, and in my spare time am
working on BioJava 3.</p>
