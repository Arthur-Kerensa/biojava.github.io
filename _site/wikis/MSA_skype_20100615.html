<h2 id="report-from-last-week">Report from last week:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The questions regarding phylo and forester library were resolved by
email</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scooter and Andreas refactored the phylo module so forester is now a
stand alone jar file</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of BioJava modules now compile and Andreas will move a automated
build system into production during the next days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mark committed the code for pairwise alignments (Needleman Wunsch).
There were a few complications, hence slight delay from last week.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>

<h3 id="how-to-deal-with-default-values">How to deal with default values?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Shall there be constructors taking many arguments, or should there be
no arguent constructors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Andreas, Kyle: no argument constructors good for serialization and
scripting langages</p>

<p>Mark: solution that is “best of both worlds”. The classes have nested
classes with default values. Will commit test cases later today then we
can take a look and provide feedback by email.</p>

<h3 id="help-for-user-to-learn-api">Help for user to learn API</h3>

<p>Scooter: FastaHelper class is an example. How should we deal with helper
classes? Andreas: The reference documentation is the BioJava Cookbook
page on the wiki.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-treat-additional-info">How to treat additional Info</h3>

<p>Kyle: what about additional info like secondary structure, solvent
accessibility</p>

<p>Scooter: Sequence is the storage container for those extra values.</p>

<p>Mark: trying to split interface from any class implememtation so people
who have different styles of scoring or alignments can provide their own
implementations and can plug it into the rest of the routine. i.e.
replace one piece while leaving the rest in place.</p>

<p>Kyle: A test case would be a MSA where a developer has some PDBs and use
the sec. struc assignment info and create a custom scorer that will use
this info for the alignment</p>

<h2 id="outlook-for-this-week">Outlook for this week:</h2>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">- Get similarity matrix from pairwise alignments</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">- Convert similarity matrix to a guide tree…</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">- Provide feedback on Mark's code for dealing with default values</code></p>
