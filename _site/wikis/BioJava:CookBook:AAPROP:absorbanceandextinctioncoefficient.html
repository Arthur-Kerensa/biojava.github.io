<h2 id="extinction-coefficient">Extinction Coefficient</h2>

<p>Extinct(Prot) = (Tyr count)*Ext(Tyr) + (Trp count)*Ext(Trp) + (Cys
count)*Ext(Cys) where Ext(Tyr) = 1490, Ext(Trp) = 5500, Ext(Cys) = 125</p>

<h2 id="absorbance">Absorbance</h2>

<p>Absorb(Prot) = Extinct(Prot) / Molecular_Weight</p>

<p>There is a boolean parameter to be set - assumeCysReduced.<br />
If assumeCysReduced is set to true, (Cys count) will always be 0.<br />
If assumeCysReduced is set to false, Every pair of Cystine will be
counted as 1.<br />
Our approach is based on
