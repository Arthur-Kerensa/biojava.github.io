<p>Hi,</p>

<p>Thanks for the contribution ;-) If I may… Could you please write some
introductory material to put the recipe in context? The Cookbook is
mainly for novice users of BioJava with little knowledge of its inner
workings and it would help a lot :-)</p>

<p>Best regards</p>

<p>Sylvain</p>
