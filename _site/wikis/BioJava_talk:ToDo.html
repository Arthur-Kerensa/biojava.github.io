<h2 id="webcvs-cvs-and-mailing-list-pages">WebCVS, CVS and Mailing list pages</h2>

<p>Is there really a need to move the CVS and mailing list pages into the
Wiki? These are special pages/interfaces to specific web applications. I
also think it would be a quite difficult job to do so. So my proposal is
to change nothing, instead just to link to it from the Wiki.</p>

<p>I’ve formatted the <a href="BioJava:Tutorial:Symbols_and_SymbolLists" title="wikilink">first
tutorial</a>. Any
feedback, suggestions, etc.? The usage of &lt;code&gt;…&lt;/code&gt; is not
consistent in the original
<a href="http://www.biojava.org/tutorials/chap1.html">page</a>. Any guidelines when
to format the namens of classes, interfaces, methods, etc.?</p>

<h2 id="docbook-to-mediawiki">DocBook to MediaWiki</h2>

<p>I’ve found a
<a href="http://mediawiki.blender.org/index.php/Meta/DocBook_to_Wiki">Python/Perl</a>
script to convert DocBook to MediaWiki. However, the Perl script does
nothing and the Python script throws an exception on my machine. Has
anyone experiences with Python to get this script working?</p>

<p>How should the conversion look like? One DocBook file to one MediaWiki
page or to many MediaWiki pages?</p>
