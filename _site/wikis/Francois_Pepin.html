<p>I am a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.mcb.mcgill.ca">McGill Center for
Bioinformatics</a>. I spend most of my time doing
on microarray analysis, cleaning up databases and parsing data, not
always in that order. My coding alternates between Java and
R/Bioconductor, with a bit of C here and there. <category:people></category:people></p>
