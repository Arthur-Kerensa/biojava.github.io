title: BioJava3 Feature Requests
---

Feature requests and bug reports should be added as [Github
issues](https://github.com/biojava/biojava/issues/). We welcome all
feature requests, both large and small.

Some example feature requests:

-   Balibase [[\#119](https://github.com/biojava/biojava/issues/119)]
-   UniProt (XML/txt)
-   port the BioJava 1 Chromatogram parser to BioJava 3
    [[\#120](https://github.com/biojava/biojava/issues/120)]
-   Variation APIs that bring together Ensembl Variation, VCF file
    format, GFF3+GVF file format, samtools, Picard, GATK, etc.
    [[\#121](https://github.com/biojava/biojava/issues/121)]
-   SCOP2 parser [[\#82](https://github.com/biojava/biojava/issues/82)]

There are also a number of algorithms where we would be interested in
[Java ports](Algorithm_Java_port "wikilink").

You can also take a look at the current list of [ BioJava
Modules](BioJava:Modules#BioJava_3.0.X "wikilink") and suggest other
missing features.
