BioJava Needs a Logo
--------------------

The new wiki site calls for a new BioJava logo. If you have ideas for a
new logo then upload your ideas here. As this will be a community
process feel free to make comments on this page about which logos you
prefer. --[Mark](User:Mark "wikilink") 21:28, 1 February 2006 (EST)

Logo Suggestions
----------------

BioJava Logo 1 ![](bio-java-logo.gif "fig:bio-java-logo.gif") Nice but
we cannot incorporate the Sun Java logo, that would need to change.

BioJava Logo 2 ![](bio-java-logo-2.gif "fig:bio-java-logo-2.gif") I like
this one.

BioJava Logo 3 ![](bio-java-logo-3.gif "fig:bio-java-logo-3.gif") This
is good.

BioJava Logo 4 ![](bio-java-logo-4.gif "fig:bio-java-logo-4.gif")

BioJava Logo 5 ![](bj-logo-5.gif "fig:bj-logo-5.gif") 5, 6 and 7 are
good but we would need to modify the cup so that we are not using the
Sun Java logo.

BioJava Logo 6 ![](bj-log4.gif "fig:bj-log4.gif")

BioJava Logo 7 ![](bj-cup1.gif "fig:bj-cup1.gif")
