BioJava Needs a Logo
--------------------

The new wiki site calls for a new BioJava logo. If you have ideas for a
new logo then upload your ideas here. As this will be a community
process feel free to make comments on this page about which logos you
prefer. --[Mark](User:Mark "wikilink") 21:28, 1 February 2006 (EST)

Logo Suggestions
----------------

Logo1 ![](bio-java-logo.gif "fig:bio-java-logo.gif") Nice but we cannot
incorporate the Sun Java logo, that would need to change.

Logo2 ![](bio-java-logo-2.gif "fig:bio-java-logo-2.gif") I like this
one.

Logo3 ![](bio-java-logo-3.gif "fig:bio-java-logo-3.gif")

This is good.

I like this one, but I think the sequence on top and bottom is too
much - can we have the middle part only? I assume the image is in the
copyright of the contributor? [andreas](User:andreas "wikilink")

Logo4 ![](bio-java-logo-4.gif "fig:bio-java-logo-4.gif")

Logo5 ![](bj-logo-5.gif "fig:bj-logo-5.gif") 5, 6 and 7 are good but we
would need to modify the cup so that we are not using the Sun Java logo.

Logo6 ![](bj-log4.gif "fig:bj-log4.gif")

Logo7 ![](bj-cup1.gif "fig:bj-cup1.gif")

Hi Mark and all. I would tend to go with the Zen look of the BioPerl
logo. You are right about the cup as it is right now (deigns 5 to 7), it
looks to much like Sun's. My original idea was to have a DNA helix swirl
out of a steaming cup of hot cocoa ;-) Could we stylized the cup with 0
and 1, a,c,g,t ? --[Foisys](User:Foisys "wikilink") 09:48, 7 February

Logo9 ![](blue_spot_logo.jpg "fig:blue_spot_logo.jpg")

-- Count my vote on this one. An idea: how about removing the blue
circle and inverting colors white to blue. This would keep the logo in
harmony with the background of the page. Just my 2
cents... --[Foisys](User:Foisys "wikilink") 15:00, 16 February 2006

Logo16 ![](Biojava_logo.gif "fig:Biojava_logo.gif")

hope you like this one ! (hwd from Taiwan)

I like the shape of this one, but the purple color is too strong. would
it be possible to provide a version with e.g. blue or green ?

Logo17 ![](Biojava_logo_jitendra.jpg "fig:Biojava_logo_jitendra.jpg")

Dear biological programmers and Biojava project lovers. I, Jitendra
Narayan (www.bioinformaticsonline.com), finally design a logo that
correctly explain the biojava project. I need your valuable comments on
it.
