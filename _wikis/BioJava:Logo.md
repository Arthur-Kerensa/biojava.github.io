BioJava Needs a Logo
--------------------

The new wiki site calls for a new BioJava logo. If you have ideas for a
new logo then upload your ideas here. As this will be a community
process feel free to make comments on this page about which logos you
prefer. --[Mark](User:Mark "wikilink") 21:28, 1 February 2006 (EST)

Logo Suggestions
----------------

BioJava Logo 1 ![](bio-java-logo.gif "fig:bio-java-logo.gif") Nice but
we cannot incorporate the Sun Java logo, that would need to change.

BioJava Logo 2 ![](bio-java-logo-2.gif "fig:bio-java-logo-2.gif") I like
this one.

BioJava Logo 3 ![](bio-java-logo-3.gif "fig:bio-java-logo-3.gif") This
is good.

BioJava Logo 4 ![](bio-java-logo-4.gif "fig:bio-java-logo-4.gif")

BioJava Logo 5 ![](bj-logo-5.gif "fig:bj-logo-5.gif") 5, 6 and 7 are
good but we would need to modify the cup so that we are not using the
Sun Java logo.

BioJava Logo 6 ![](bj-log4.gif "fig:bj-log4.gif")

BioJava Logo 7 ![](bj-cup1.gif "fig:bj-cup1.gif")

Hi Mark and all. I would tend to go with the Zen look of the BioPerl
logo. You are right about the cup as it is right now (deigns 5 to 7), it
looks to much like Sun's. My original idea was to have a DNA helix swirl
out of a steaming cup of hot cocoa ;-) Could we stylized the cup with 0
and 1, a,c,g,t ? --[Foisys](User:Foisys "wikilink") 09:48, 7 February
