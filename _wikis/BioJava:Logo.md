BioJava Needs a Logo
--------------------

The new wiki site calls for a new BioJava logo. If you have ideas for a
new logo then upload your ideas here. As this will be a community
process feel free to make comments on this page about which logos you
prefer. --[Mark](User:Mark "wikilink") 21:28, 1 February 2006 (EST)
