Andreas Dräger implemented sequence alignment algorithms as the
Needleman-Wunsch-Algorithm for global alignments and the
Smith-Waterman-Algorithm for local alignments including an output
formatting function that produces a BLAST like output of the aligned
sequences. He also improved the database interaction with BioSQL,
escpecially the storage of taxonomic information in the database and
contributed some suggestions for further developement of BioJava.
