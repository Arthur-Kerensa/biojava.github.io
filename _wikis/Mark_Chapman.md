[Mark Chapman](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~chapman/) is a graduate student
in [Computer Sciences](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at the [University of
Wisconsin](http://www.wisc.edu/) - Madison. Currently, he has been
accepted to work on BioJava during the [Google Summer of
Code](Google Summer of Code "wikilink") 2010. With the guidance of
[Andreas Prlic](Andreas Prlic "wikilink"), Scooter Willis, and Kyle
Ellrott, he plans to develop a multiple sequence alignment module and
update the pairwise alignment module to fit the [BioJava3
Design](BioJava3 Design "wikilink"). A dedicated page at <GSoC:MSA> has
an overview and timeline for the summer.
