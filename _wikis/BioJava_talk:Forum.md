A link to the dbSNP discussion should probably be posted on the mailing

Regading BIOSQL files
---------------------

Dear all,

I have downloaded the BioSQL db files, viz:-

biosqldb-pg.sql biosqldb-assembly-pg.sql biosql-accelerators-pg.sql

When i am trying to compile the biosqldb-pg.sql file, it gives me a
error. stating that the following error.

![](C:\error.jpg "C:\error.jpg")

If any1 could tell me how to rectify these errors and work ahead, it
would be very nice.

Hello Guys, following the time evolution of the problems posted the
list, I have a problem you'd like great ideas I read that here, my case
is problematic:

Working with Bioinformatics applied to proteomics, using the software 3D
Image Master Plantinum to analysis of images acquired from scanner of
gels containing proteins in it, give this application analytical is
limited when we move the spot (the point where it is against the
protein) in order to publish the statistical analysis and papers.

I need to develop an application or script to automate this function
within the software, so when researchers can instead use the pencil to
highlight the spots, with only one click the circle is positioned on the
spot in the gel

best regards
