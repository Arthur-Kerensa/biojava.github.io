Hi - I moved your entry in the Discussion section since it might
generate comments that are outside the scope of the CookBook. Actually
your idea is quite interesting. Why not make a page with some of the
papers that were created using BioJava and come back to the Cookbook
page and add the link? --[Foisys](User:Foisys "wikilink") 15:19, 6
