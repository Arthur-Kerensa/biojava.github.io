-   Hi, thanks for shutting out all those spammers in the last couple of
    days. Do you think we need to take other action to get rid of this
    problem? --[Andreas](User:Andreas "wikilink") 03:38, 15 July 2009

-   Just to let you know, we have had some problems on the othe Bio\*
    wiki sites with spammers. You should go ahead and create a
    `Index.php` page, then protect it for sysops only
    ([Bioperl](http://bioperl.org) and [Biopython](http://biopython.org)
    both resorted to this). Also, the Bioperl and Biopython wikis have
    set up a Blacklist page which is supposed to cut down on the amount
    of spam. Don't know if you have that
    here. --[Cjfields](User:Cjfields "wikilink") 15:36, 11 August 2006

-   I would be more than willing to do so! Jason S. got me admin
    priviliges on the BioJava site but I can't seem to be able to find
    it and his email address that I have is not responding anymore... I
    would need a small how-to on how to do what you propose though. Best
    regards. --[Foisys](User:Foisys "wikilink") 10:24, 17 August 2006
