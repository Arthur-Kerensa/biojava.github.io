My career in bioinformatics started at
[AgResearch](http://www.agresearch.co.nz/) in New Zealand, then moving
to the [Genome Institute of Singapore](http://www.gis.a-star.edu.sg/).

I used BioJava for a while but got seriously involved after working with
[Mark Schreiber](User:Mark "wikilink") on the
[DengueInfo](http://www.dengueinfo.org/) project in Singapore, which
required BioJava to be able to work seamlessly with
[BioSQL](http://biosql.org/) databases. As this was not completely
possible in version 1.4, we produced the BioJavaX extensions released in
version 1.5 that allow BioJava to use the Hibernate framework for
accessing BioSQL.

I spent the next couple of years after Singapore working at the
[EBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/) at Hinxton on the
[BioMart](http://www.biomart.org) team. In Summer 2007 I mentored a
student for the Google Summer of Code, Boh-Yun Lee, who worked on some
phyloinformatics modules for us. The GSoC'07 project was organised by
[NESCent](http://www.nescent.org/).

I am now self-employed as part of a new biotech startup in Cambridge,
[Eagle Genomics](http://www.eaglegenomics.com/), and in my spare time am
working on BioJava 3.
