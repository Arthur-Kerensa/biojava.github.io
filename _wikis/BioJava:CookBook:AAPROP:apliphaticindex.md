### How is Apliphatic Index computed?

The aliphatic index of a protein is defined as the relative volume
occupied by aliphatic side chains (alanine, valine, isoleucine, and
leucine).  
It may be regarded as a positive factor for the increase of
thermostability of globular proteins.

Aliphatic index = ( (Ala count) + a \* (Val count) + b \* (Ile count) +
b \* (Leu count) ) \* 100 where a = 2.9 and b = 3.9  
 Our approach is based on
