### How is Apliphatic Index computed?

The aliphatic index of a protein is defined as the relative volume
occupied by aliphatic side chains (alanine, valine, isoleucine, and
leucine). It may be regarded as a positive factor for the increase of
thermostability of globular proteins. The aliphatic index of a protein
is calculated according to the following formula [8]:

Aliphatic index = X(Ala) + a \* X(Val) + b \* ( X(Ile) + X(Leu) )

where X(Ala), X(Val), X(Ile), and X(Leu) are mole percent (100 X mole
fraction)

of alanine, valine, isoleucine, and leucine.

The coefficients a and b are the relative volume of valine side chain (a
= 2.9)

and of Leu/Ile side chains (b = 3.9) to the side chain of alanine.
