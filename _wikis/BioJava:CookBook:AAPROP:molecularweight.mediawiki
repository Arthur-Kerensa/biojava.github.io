===How is Molecular Weight computed?===

Molecular Weight is computed as the sum of the mass of each amino acid plus a water molecule.<br/>
The mass of the water molecule is 17.0073(OH) + 1.0079(H).<br/>
The default mass of each amino acid is using the average mass from table 2 of this [http://web.expasy.org/findmod/findmod_masses.html website].
<p>
More advance users who would like to define the mass of each amino acid can do so via XML files.<br/>
