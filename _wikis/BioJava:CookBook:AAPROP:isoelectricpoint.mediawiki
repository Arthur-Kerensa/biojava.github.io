===How is Isoelectric Point computed?===

The isoelectric point, pI, is the pH at which the net charge of the peptide is zero. We first computes the net charge for pH 7.0.<br/>
If the charge is > 0, the next pH to check is 7 + 3.5.<br/>
If the charge is < 0 then pH 7 - 3.5 is checked.<br/> 
This is repeated, using increments/decrements half the size of the previous, until the modulus of the charge found is less than or equal to 0.0001.<br/>

pKa values used can be chosen between the following two sources with ExPASy being the default one.

1) ExPASy - ProtParam [http://web.expasy.org/protparam/]

OR

2) A.Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry, 4th Edition (2005), Chapter 3, page 78, Table 3-1.
