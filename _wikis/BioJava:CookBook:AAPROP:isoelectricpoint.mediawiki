===How is Isoelectric Point computed?===

The isoelectric point, pI, is the pH at which the net charge of the peptide is zero. We first computes the net charge for pH 7.0.<br/>
If the charge is > 0, the next pH to check is 7 + 3.5.<br/>
If the charge is < 0 then pH 7 - 3.5 is checked.<br/> 
This is repeated, using increments/decrements half the size of the previous, until the modulus of the charge found is less than or equal to 0.0001.<br/>

pKa values used can be chosen between the following two websites with ExPASy being the default one.

1) ExPASy - ProtParam [http://web.expasy.org/protparam/]

OR

2) Innovagen [http://www.innovagen.se/custom-peptide-synthesis/peptide-property-calculator/peptide-property-calculator-notes.asp#PI].<br/>
Do note that the pKa values referenced by Innovagen are based on Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, Third Edition.<br/>
Currently in the process of updating to 4th Edition.<br/>
