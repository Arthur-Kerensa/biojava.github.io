===How is Isoelectric Point computed?===

The isoelectric point, pI, is the pH at which the net charge of the peptide is zero. We first computes the net charge for pH 7.0. 
If the charge is > 0, the next pH to check is 7 + 3.5.
If the charge is < 0 then pH 7 - 3.5 is checked. 
This is repeated, using increments/decrements half the size of the previous, until the modulus of the charge found is less than or equal to 0.0000001.
Our approach is derivate from [[http://www.innovagen.se/custom-peptide-synthesis/peptide-property-calculator/peptide-property-calculator-notes.asp#PI here]].
