title: BioJava:ToDo
---

What needs starting?
--------------------

-   BioJavaX docbook need converting to Wiki - quite hard
-   Conversion of cookbook and tutorials to reflect 1.4 (and/or
    BioJavax) conventions - requires someone with in-depth knowledge of
    the complete workings of BioJava
-   Consolidate cookbook, tutorials and BJX docbook into a single
    HowTo - time-consuming, might as well just write a book!
-   User mailing list - easy
-   Susbcribe to mailing list - easy
-   Mailing list archive - not sure how to transfer this? Probably link
    to old archive
-   Dev mailing list stuff - as per user mailing list
-   Related sites eg bioperl, biopython etc - easy, could use interwiki

Whats in progress?
------------------

-   Choosing a logo!
-   Tutorial - laborious but straightforward, some parts are in need of
    updating and/or are no longer relevant (Formatting is done --

-   Participants - Mostly links to user pages. eg User:Mark. This is not
    ideal. Jason is going to set up a People domain then we can set
    User:Mark to redirect to People:Mark Schreiber

Inspiration
-----------

If you don't know the best way to do it take a look at the
[bioperl](bp:Main_Page "wikilink") home page for inspiration.

Also try looking at the [bioperl style guide](bp:Style_guide "wikilink")
for hints on making links etc
