Hi,

 Can someone tell me how to get the Identities (percentage of holology) from Balstp output using BlastLikeSAXParser? Or is it possible to get Identities (percentage of holology) from Balstp output using BlastLikeSAXParser?

I am following the example from this link:     http://www.biojava.org/wiki/BioJava:CookBook:Blast:Parser
I can get score, eValue, pValue, but not the Identities. Any idea how to get Identities? Or should I write my own parser?

Thanks,

David
