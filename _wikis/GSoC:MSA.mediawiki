'''Improvements including Multiple Sequence Alignment Algorithms'''

''[[Google Summer of Code]] Project by [[Mark Chapman]]''

''Mentored by [[Andreas Prlic]]''

''Co-mentored by Scooter Willis and Kyle Ellrott''

Biologists infer evolutionary, structural, and functional relationships
between biopolymers from similarities and divergences of primary
structure in multiple sequence alignments.  This summer project will add
a module which manages an alignment and offers several implementation
options.  Initial code will establish a framework for alignments that
outlines a standard four stage approach of pairwise similarity
calculation, hierarchical clustering, progressive alignment, and
refinement.  Each step will get filled in with details from the most
pervasive progressive alignment algorithm, clustalw.  Further work will
then add alternative methods which update the stages to increase speed,
improve accuracy, or change the scope of the multiple sequence alignment.

==Milestones==

The first milestone consists of mostly design work, setting up package
outlines, and writing interface hierarchies.  The goal is to create an
interface that allows both simple use with preset options and advanced
customization.  This will update the current alignment module to BioJava
3 and define the extension to multiple sequence alignments.  The
independence of the program components is key here.  For example,
pairwise alignments that rely on annotations of function or structure
could create a similarity matrix while the rest of the routine defaults
to run like clustalw.  This flexible interface will allow the addition of
more modern algorithms since most still follow the same four stage
approach and even rely on many of the classic algorithms at some point
during the alignment.

The second phase of this project implements a default alignment routine
based on clustalw.  Output from updated pairwise alignments will connect
to the existing hierarchical clustering algorithms in the phylogeny
module.  Then, the resulting tree will guide a progressive alignment
which outputs a multiple sequence alignment.  This requires a data
structure to hold profiles of multiple sequences and an algorithm for
profile-profile alignment.  Even the original release of clustalw uses
several improvements to the naive algorithm which increase speed and
accuracy.

For the remainder of the summer, enhancements will be added to each
alignment stage.  Many improvements upon clustalw have been published
including clustalw2, muscle, kalign, dialign, mafft, fsa, probcons, and
t-coffee, and psalign.  Likely algorithms to integrate this summer are
pairwise similarities from Needleman-Wunsch (clustalw), K-mers
(clustalw/muscle), Wu-Manber (kalign), and structure (psc++/ce/fatcat),
guide trees from Neighbor Joining and UPGMA, profile-profile alignment
using a profile matrix (clustalw) or additive profile vectors (muscle)
with anchored restriction (Myers-Miller/muscle/dialign), and refinement
by both iterating (clustalw/muscle) and partitioning (muscle/kalign).
