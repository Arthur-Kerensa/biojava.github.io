This page will contain a bunch of use-cases which will drive development for BioJava 3. Please add them below - as simple or as complex as you wish!

== Use cases ==

* Multiple GenBank sequences inside a single file (ftp://bio-mirror.net/biomirror/genbank/gbbct1.seq.gz) can be easily indexed.
* Is it possible to write the sequence to any object instead of writing it to a PrintStream?

            genbankFormat.writeSequence(richSequence, printStream);
