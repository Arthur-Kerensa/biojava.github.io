David left a career in petroleum refining in 1986 to do an MSc followed
by a PhD in molecular biology. He worked initially on cancer biology and
cell signalling but has since switched to Drosophila genetics. He is
currently a postdoc with the Ashburner group doing both bench work and
bioinformatics. David initially learnt BioJava when he had to move large
numbers of annotations he accumulated on certain regions of the
Drosophila genome when the coordinate framework of the Drosophila genome
was changed in a new release. That task remains most cussedly undone but
he has moved on to using BioJava routinely in other activities. His most
lasting contributions to BioJava tend to be bugfixes but his most recent
contribution was a SymbolList regex package. On the other hand, some of
his earlier contributions will most deservedly be taken out back and
shot.

His current BioJava activity centres around HMM models for comparative
genomics and novel software approaches for analysis of chromatin
immunoprecipitation microarray results. Most of this software will
eventually end up in BioJava somewhere.
