Eclipse is a common IDE for using BioJava.

Prerequisites
-------------

1.  Download Eclipse from
    [<http://www.eclipse.org/>](http://www.eclipse.org/). Several
    flavors are available, which come with different pre-installed
    plugins. We recommend starting with 'Eclipse IDE for Java
    Developers'.
2.  Install the following plugins. See [\#Plugin
    Installation](#Plugin_Installation "wikilink") below for detailed
    instructions.
    -   m2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse
    -   Eclipse EGit
    -   m2e-egit SCM Handler

Cloning the repository
----------------------

We recommend [creating a
fork](Contributing to BioJava#Forking_Biojava "wikilink") on github for
day-to-day development. In the following instructions you should
substitute something like '<https://github.com/><username>/biojava.git'
for the repository URL. If you don't want to make a fork (for instance,
if you don't plan to make any changes), you can follow the instructions
below exactly.

*TODO: write instructions*

Plugin Installation
-------------------

*This section needs to be expanded with specific instructions for
installing plugins using either Marketplace or directly from the Install
software menu.*
