=A simple GUI for protein structure alignment=

BioJava (in SVN) contains a simple GUI for easier working with protein structure alignments.
The following code launches the user interface:

<java>
import org.biojava.bio.structure.gui.*;

public static void main(String[] args){
	new AlignmentGui();	
}
</java>

In the user interface specify 2 PDB files (and optionally chain IDs) that should be superimposed.

After pressing the *Submit* button, the alignment is calculated. A new frame pops up that shows the alternative solutions for this alignment:

The columns in this table are:
<pre>
#1    the number of the alternative alignment
eqr   the number of structurally equivalent residues
score the score for this alternative alignment
rms   root mean sqare
gaps  number of gaps in the alignment
</pre>

The *Show in Jmol* button allows to display this alternative alignment in Jmol, if it can be found on the classpath.

The *Distance Matrix* button shows the distance matrix that is used for the alignment and the path that has been choosen.


===Configure PDB installation (Optional)===
If you have a PDB installation that contains all PDB files in a single directory you can configure the System property PDB_DIR to point to this directory. (e.g. at startup specify -DPDB_DIR=path/to/PDB/files )
