Hi - I moved your entry in the Discussion section since it might generate comments that are outside the scope of the CookBook. Actually your idea is quite interesting. Why not make a page with some of the papers that were created using BioJava and come back to the Cookbook page and add the link? --[[User:Foisys|Foisys]] 15:19, 6 February 2006 (EST)


Hi - I've searched for anything about this and found the followings:

http://www.google.com.br/search?as_q=using+Biojava&num=10&hl=pt-BR&btnG=Pesquisa+Google&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=pdf&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&as_rights=&safe=images

Hi- That's the link that I have put in the french version: http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=biojava&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en. My suggestion is to create  a page where some representative apps created using BioJava could be showcased.

What do people think about the links to STRAP here?
this are links out to their web site. No content in this wiki is provided and it does not feel like the BioJava cookbook page
is the right place for this. Perhaps this should better be moved
to the [[BioJava:BioJavaInside|applications that are based on biojava page]]? --[[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 18:39, 21 January 2008 (EST)
