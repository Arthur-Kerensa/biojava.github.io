Hi - I moved your entry in the Discussion section since it might generate comments that are outside the scope of the CookBook. Actually your idea is quite interesting. Why not make a page with some of the papers that were created using BioJava and come back to the Cookbook page and add the link? --[[User:Foisys|Foisys]] 15:19, 6 February 2006 (EST)


Hi - I've searched for anything about this and found the followings:

http://www.google.com.br/search?as_q=using+Biojava&num=10&hl=pt-BR&btnG=Pesquisa+Google&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=pdf&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&as_rights=&safe=images

Hi- That's the link that I have put in the french version: http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=biojava&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en. My suggestion is to create  a page where some representative apps created using BioJava could be showcased.
