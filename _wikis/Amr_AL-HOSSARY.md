I am a PhD student in NTU (Nanyang Technological University), Singapore.

I started working with BioJava in 2009 when I was searching for a
library to manage PDB files for my masters. Since then I made several
contributions after my masters and during my PhD (PDB parser, PDB file
life cycle, Stockholm parser, and some internal code optimizations).
