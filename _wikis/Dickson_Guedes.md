Dickson S. Guedes
-----------------

I was born in [Laguna](wp:Laguna (Santa Catarina) "wikilink") but now I
live in Tubar√£o, [Santa Catarina](wp:Santa Catarina (state) "wikilink"),
[Brazil](wp:Brazil "wikilink") and work in
[UNISUL](http://www.unisul.br) - a local University of [Santa
Catarina](wp:Santa Catarina (state) "wikilink").

I've contributed with BioJava by porting the
[CookBook's](Biojava:Cookbook "wikilink") English version to this Wiki,
but I've introduced to BioJava at 2005, when I've started my Bacharel's
thesis using it how a framework to contruct [Phylogenetic
trees](wp:Phylogenetic trees "wikilink") "powered by" [Genetic
algorithms](wp:Genetic algorithms "wikilink"). So... if all dones right,
I'll presents my tesis at July of 2006... good luck for me.. ":)
