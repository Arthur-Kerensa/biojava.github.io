At the end of March 2013, BioJava will move from SVN to GIT for version control.

== Benefits of the move ==

* Use branches in your daily workflow without merge terror
* Track buggy/untested code without breaking the build for everyone else
* Collaborate within a small team before sharing the finished feature
* Simple, well integrated bug tracking
* Accept contributions from the public via pull requests

== Current Situation ==

The primary BioJava SVN repository requires an ssh account for each developer. As described in [http://biojava.org/w/index.php?title=Developer_Code_Access&oldid=5082 Developer Code Access]), the repository url is 

  svn co svn+ssh://dev.open-bio.org/home/svn-repositories/biojava/biojava-live/trunk/

There are also two read-only mirrors which permit anonymous access. The recommended public access point for SVN is

  svn co http://code.open-bio.org/repos/biojava/biojava-live/trunk

A commit hook is used to update a github mirror after each commit. This repository is read-only (by policy). Although it is possible to develop from a GIT clone & submit push-requests with new code, none such requests are accepted. Github repositories can be accessed using either GIT (recommended) or SVN<ref>Github blog. [https://github.com/blog/626-announcing-svn-support Announcing SVN support].

  git clone https://github.com/biojava/biojava.git

  svn co --depth empty https://github.com/biojava/biojava
  svn up biojava/trunk
  
Neither of these methods are recommended, although they have been suggested to work around open-bio.org server problems.
 
== Developers ==

=== Linking SVN to GIT ===
As an open source project we want to make sure that contributors are fairly acknowledged. Moving to github requires using github accounts to identify developers. This means linking old SVN account names to a github account so that past and future contributions are linked to the same person.

# Wherever possible, map SVN accounts to Github accounts. Most active developers have already added themselves to the google spreadsheet to enable this (see mailing list)
# If no Github account is known, associate SVN account with their email address. Developers can link this email to a github account at a future time, which will automatically tie them to past commits
# If no email address is known, or the email is no longer accessible, commits will be credited to their SVN account name only.

=== User permissions ===
We currently have two classes of SVN permissions:

# ''Developers.'' Full write access to any Biojava project through the developer SVN.
# ''Users.'' Read-only access to the anonymous mirrors.

The decentralized nature of GIT will allow a third class of users:

# ''Developers.'' Members of the [https://github.com/biojava?tab=members Biojava Github organization]. Can configure push access on a project-specific level.
# ''Contributors.'' Github users who are not part of the biojava organization, but maintain a personal fork of the project & submit push requests
# ''Users.'' General users who clone the code & don't submit push requests.

Current developers may find it easier to submit push requests rather than join the Biojava organization. However, frequent contributors should join so that the burden of accepting pull requests does not become too high for the administrators.
