Download latest automated builds for BioJava
--------------------------------------------

BioJava developers frequently fix bugs or add new features in the
[BioJava SVN repository](CVS_to_SVN_Migration "wikilink"). You can
either obtain an [anonymous SVN
checkout](CVS_to_SVN_Migration "wikilink") or download an automated
build based on the latest SVN content.

The automated builds make sure that the source code repository at all
times compiles fine and all JUnit tests are passed correctly. If this is
the case, a Maven based SNAPSHOT build of all biojava modules is created
and automatically provided for download at the BioJava Maven repository.
Note: Snapshot builds are based on the latest source code checkout which
might contain experimental or alpha-release source code. If you are
interested in using the current stable release, please obtain a download
from <BioJava:Download> instead.
