What needs starting?
--------------------

-   Conversion of cookbook and tutorials to reflect 1.4 (and/or
    BioJavax) conventions - requires someone with in-depth knowledge of
    the complete workings of BioJava
-   Consolidate cookbook, tutorials and BJX docbook into a single
    HowTo - time-consuming, might as well just write a book!
-   Related sites eg bioperl, biopython etc - easy, could use interwiki

Whats in progress?
------------------

-   Choosing a logo!
-   CookBook (/wikis/BioJava in Anger) Portuguese

Inspiration
-----------

If you don't know the best way to do it take a look at the
[bioperl](bp:Main_Page "wikilink") home page for inspiration.

Also try looking at the [bioperl style guide](bp:Style_guide "wikilink")
for hints on making links etc
