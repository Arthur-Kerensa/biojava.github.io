Combinatorial Extension with Circular Permutations (CE-CP) is a
structural comparison algorithm provided by BioJava. It provides the
ability to compare protein structures related by a circular permutation.
In circularly permutated proteins, the N-terminal part of one protein is
related to the C-terminal part of the other, and vice versa. For more
information on circular permutations, see the
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_permutation_in_proteins)
