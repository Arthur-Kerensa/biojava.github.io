==How can I get the list of supported protein modifications?==
The protmod module contains [http://code.open-bio.org/svnweb/index.cgi/biojava/browse/biojava-live/trunk/biojava3-protmod/src/main/resources/org/biojava3/protmod an XML file], defining a list of protein modifications, retrieved from [http://www.wwpdb.org/ccd.html Protein Data Bank Chemical Component Dictrionary], [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/RESID/ RESID], and [http://psidev.sourceforge.net/mod/ PSI-MOD]. It contains many common modifications such glycosylation, phosphorylation, acelytation, methylation, etc. Crosslinks are also included, such disulfide bonds and iso-peptide bonds. 

The protmod maintains a registry of supported protein modifications. The list of protein modifications contained in the XML file will be automatically loaded. You can [[BioJava:CookBook3:AddProtMod | define and add a new protein modification]] if it has not been defined in the XML file. From the protein modification registry, a user can retrieve
* all protein modifications,
* a protein modification by ID,
* a set of protein modifications by RESID ID,
* a set of protein modifications by PSI-MOD ID,
* a set of protein modifications by PDBCC ID,
* a set of protein modifications by category (attachment, modified residue, crosslink1, crosslink2, ..., crosslink7),
* a set of protein modifications by occurrence type (natural or hypothetical),
* a set of protein modifications by a keyword (glycoprotein, phosphoprotein, sulfoprotein, ...),
* a set of protein modifications by involved components.

==Example: retrieve registered protein modifications==
<java>
// all protein modifications
Set<ProteinModification> mods = ProteinModification.allModifications();

// a protein modification by ID
ProteinModification mod = ProteinModification.getById("0001");

// a set of protein modifications by RESID ID
Set<ProteinModification> mods = ProteinModification.getByResidId("AA0151");

// a set of protein modifications by PSI-MOD ID
Set<ProteinModification> mods = ProteinModification.getByPsimodId("MOD:00160");

// a set of protein modifications by PDBCC ID
Set<ProteinModification> mods = ProteinModification.getByPdbccId("SEP");

// a set of protein modifications by category
Set<ProteinModification> mods = ProteinModification.getByCategory(ModificationCategory.ATTACHMENT);

// a set of protein modifications by occurrence type
Set<ProteinModification> mods = ProteinModification.getByOccurrenceType(ModificationOccurrenceType.NATURAL);

// a set of protein modifications by a keyword
Set<ProteinModification> mods = ProteinModification.getByKeyword("phosphoprotein");

// a set of protein modifications by involved components.
Set<ProteinModification> mods = ProteinModification.getByComponent(Component.of("FAD", ComponentType.LIGAND));
