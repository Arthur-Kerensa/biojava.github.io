== Download latest automated builds from SVN: ==

BioJava developers frequently fix bugs or add new features in the [[CVS_to_SVN_Migration|BioJava SVN repository]]. You can either obtain an [[CVS_to_SVN_Migration|anonymous SVN checkout]] or download an automated build based on the latest SVN content

The automated builds make sure that the source code repository at all times compiles fine and all JUnit tests are passed correctly.  If this is the case, a biojava.jar is created and automatically provided for download. Download the latest successful build from the links below. Note: This is the latest source code checkout which might contain experimental or alpha-release source code. If you are interested in using the latest stable release, please obtain a download from [[BioJava:Download]] instead.
