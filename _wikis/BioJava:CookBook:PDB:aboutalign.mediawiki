= About the Structure alignment algorithm =

The structure alignment algorithm contained in BioJava is based on a variation of the PSC++ algorithm provided by Peter Lackner, Univ. Salzburg (personal communication). The algorithm is calculating a distance matrix based, rigid body protein structure superimposition. See also a JavaWebStart example of how it works at [[BioJava:Performance]].

== What can it do? ==

calculate alignments of 
 * whole structures, 
 * single chains
 * any set of atoms
 * it provides alternative solutions

== How does it work? ==

[http://code.open-bio.org/svnweb/index.cgi/biojava/view/biojava-live/trunk/src/org/biojava/bio/structure/align/StructurePairAligner.java View the source code]

 * It identifies short fragments in two protein structures that have similar intra-molecular distances. 
 * The pairs of fragments are then compared and if possible, joined to longer fragments.
 * Finally the fragments are undergoing a refinement procedure in order to extend them to full size alignments.
