== WebCVS, CVS and Mailing list pages ==

Is there really a need to move the CVS and mailing list pages into the Wiki? These are special pages/interfaces to specific web applications. I also think it would be a quite difficult job to do so. So my proposal is to change nothing, instead just to link to it from the Wiki.

== First tutorial online ==

I've formatted the [[BioJava:Tutorial:Symbols_and_SymbolLists|first tutorial]]. Any feedback, suggestions, etc.? The usage of <nowiki><code>...</code></nowiki> is not consistent in the original [http://www.biojava.org/tutorials/chap1.html page]. Any guidelines when to format the namens of classes, interfaces, methods, etc.?

== DocBook to MediaWiki ==

I've found a [http://mediawiki.blender.org/index.php/Meta/DocBook_to_Wiki Python/Perl] script to convert DocBook to MediaWiki. However, the Perl script does nothing and the Python script throws an exception on my machine. Has anyone experiences with Python to get this script working?

How should the conversion look like? One DocBook file to one MediaWiki page or to many MediaWiki pages?
