Code here didn't work for me (tested windows and linux blast, many output formats), but using the code under demobs/blastxml/BlastParser.java did work... also found several hits on google of other people having the same issue.  Consider replacing/adding that here?-[[User:Oneplus999|Oneplus999]]

I recommend either posting the exact nature of the problem to the mailing list, or if you fixed the problem, would be great if you could create a new page for your solution and hook it up with the cookbook.
