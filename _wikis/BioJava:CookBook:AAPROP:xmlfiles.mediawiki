===How should I define the XML files to customize mass of Amino Acids in the computation of Molecular Weight?===

There are two XML files which you would need to define in order to customize mass of Amino Acids.

1) ElementMass - This file should define the name and mass of elements and isotopes.

2) AminoAcidComposition - This file should define all the elements and isotopes that are contained for each Amino Acid.

For ease of use, the standard mass of elements and isotopes are already saved in [[BioJava:CookBook:AAPROP:ElementMass.xml ElementMass.xml]]. 
Likewise, the standard composition of amino acids are also stored in [[BioJava:CookBook:AAPROP:AminoAcidComposition.xml AminoAcidComposition.xml]].
