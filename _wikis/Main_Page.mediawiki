==Welcome to BioJava==
See the [http://biojava.open-bio.org/news BioJava news page] for BioJava news.

This site is built by the biojava community. We are currently in the process of moving the old biojava site to this site. Click [[Project:ToDo|here]] for a todo list.

It include objects for manipulating biological sequences, file parsers, [http://biodas.org/ DAS] client and server suport, access to [http://www.biosql.org/ BioSQL] and [http://www.ensembl.org Ensembl] databases, tools for making sequence analysis GUIs and powerful analysis and statistical routines including a dynamic programming toolkit.

== New Logo Needed! ==

The BioJava project needs a new Logo. The sunflower in the top left corner of this page doesn't really do it justice. If you have artistic flair then upload you logo to this [[Project:logo|page]]. Everyone feel free to make your comments about which ones you like. At some as yet undecided point one will become the official logo.
