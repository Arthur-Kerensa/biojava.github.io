About
-----

BioJava Legacy 1.8.5 has been released and is available using Maven from
<http://biojava.org/download/maven/>

Over the last year BioJava has undergone a major re-write. A new code
base has been started under the codename [BioJava
3](BioJava:Download "wikilink"). The old BioJava code (or BioJava 1 or
BioJava Legacy) has been modularized into small, re-usable components
and is available for download on this page.

Maven Download
--------------

BioJava Legacy 1.8.5 requires [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) for the
build process. We are providing a BioJava specific Maven repository at
<http://biojava.org/download/maven/> .

You can add the BioJava repository by adding the following XML to your
project .pom file:
