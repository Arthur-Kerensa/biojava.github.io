Michael Heuer is a long-time Biojava lurker and a rare contributor.
Half-baked ideas and unfinished implementations of things that may make
it into Biojava at some point can be found at his personal development
site, dishevelled. org (http://www.dishevelled.org/).

Michael presented Biojava at BOSC 2005, Biojava spinoff project StAX
(http://stax.sf.net) in a lightning talk at BOSC 2005, and Biojava at
BOSC 2008. See [BOSC2008\_Abstract](BOSC2008_Abstract "wikilink") and
