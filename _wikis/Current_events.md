BioJava 1.6 released
--------------------

Version 1.6 release announcement to biojava-dev and biojava-l

Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2008 19:02:41 +0100 From: Andreas Prlic To:
biojava-dev at biojava.org, biojava-l at biojava.org Subject:
[Biojava-dev] biojava 1.6 released

Biojava 1.6 has been released and is available from <BioJava:Download>

Biojava 1.6 offers more functionality and stability over the previous
official releases. BioJava now depends on Java 1.5+. We highly recommend
you to upgrade as soon as possible.

In detail, the phylo package org.biojavax.bio.phylo was improved and
expanded by our GSOC'07 student Boh-Yun Lee. It now contains fully-
functional Nexus and Phylip parsers, and tools for calculating UPGMA and
Neighbour Joining, Jukes-Kantor and Kimura Two Parameter, and MP. It
uses JGraphT to represent parsed trees.

The PDB file parser was improved by Jules Jacobsen for better dealing
with PDB header records. Andreas Draeger provided several patches for
improving the Genetic Algorithm modules. Additionally this release
contains numerous bug fixes and documentation improvements.

Thanks to the entire biojava community for making this possible!

Happy Biojava-ing,

Andreas

BOSC 2007 Presentation
----------------------

For those of you who can't be in Vienna for Richard's biojava
presentation for BOSC 2007. You can view the pdf
[here](http://www.biojava.org/download/files/bosc2007.pdf).

NESCent Phyloinformatics and the Google Summer of Code
------------------------------------------------------

BioJava is hosting a student from the [Google Summer of
Code](http://code.google.com/soc) who is planning on developing and
extending the phyloinformatics APIs in BioJava. Bohyun Lee aims to
create parsers for the common phyloinformatics file formats (Nexus
etc.), provide an object model for storing trees, and provide API
methods for manipulating and querying those trees.

The project is part of the [NESCent
Phyloinformatics](http://phylosoc.nescent.org/) group of projects.

Bohyun will be [documenting progress and discussing
plans](Project:PhyloSOC07 "wikilink") as the project progresses. Please
feel free to chip in with your own comments and suggestions.
