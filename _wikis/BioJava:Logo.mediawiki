== Logo Suggestions ==
Logo1 
[[Image:bio-java-logo.gif]]   Nice but we cannot incorporate the Sun Java logo, that would need to change.




Logo2
[[Image:bio-java-logo-2.gif]]    I like this one.




Logo3

This is good.

I like this one, but I think the sequence on top and bottom is too much - can we have the middle part only? I assume the cup is in the copyright of the contributor? [[User:andreas|andreas]]




Logo4

Logo5
[[Image:bj-logo-5.gif]]    5, 6 and 7 are good but we would need to modify the cup so that we are not using the Sun Java logo.

Hi Mark and all. I would tend to go with the Zen look of the BioPerl logo. You are right about the cup as it is right now (deigns 5 to 7), it looks to much like Sun's. My original idea was to have a DNA helix swirl out of a steaming cup of hot cocoa ;-) Could we stylized the cup with 0 and 1, a,c,g,t ? --[[User:Foisys|Foisys]] 09:48, 7 February 2006 (EST)

-- Count my vote on this one. An idea: how about removing the blue circle and inverting colors white to blue. This would keep the logo in harmony with the background of the page. Just my 2 cents... --[[User:Foisys|Foisys]] 15:00, 16 February 2006 (EST)
