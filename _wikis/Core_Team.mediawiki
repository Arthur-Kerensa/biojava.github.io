These gurus laboured tirelessly as core developers in the early days of BioJava. Many are only semi-retired and still lurk on the mailing list. Occasionaly their oracular wisdom can be heard permeating the AEthers of the web.

== Becoming a Core Developer ==
Generally a person is asked to join the Core development team after showing significant leadership and contribution to the project. A core developer is an individual willing to take on the responsibilities of timely code releases, answering questions from users and developers on the Mailing list, and generally setting a vision for the project. If you feel yourself or other individuals have shown themselves to be a dedicated developer to the project and that they should be part of the leadership team, please email a current Core developer.
