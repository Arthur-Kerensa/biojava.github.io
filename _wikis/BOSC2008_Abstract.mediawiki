'''Abstract:'''

The small Abstract text should be a summary, while the longer abstract should provide more details, including the open-source license requirement details.


Copied from BioJavaBioinformatics.odt [http://code.open-bio.org/svnweb/index.cgi/biojava/browse/biojava-paper?rev=4751] abstract summary with minor revision:

BioJava is a mature Open Source project that provides a framework for processing of biological data.  BioJava provides tools for parsing common file formats, manipulating sequences and 3D structures. Powerful analysis and statistical routines enable the rapid bioinformatics application development in the Java programming language [http://java.sun.com [http://java.sun.com]]. Here we present the latest BioJava release (version 1.6, released on 13 Apr 2008) which provides improvements in the packages for phylogenetic trees, processing PDB files, and genetic algorithms.


'''Paper:'''

Full-length abstracts are limited to one page with one inch (2.5 cm) margins on the top, sides, and bottom.  The full-length abstract should include the title, authors, and affiliations.

I have added myself to the author's list from the application note near the end.  Hopefully this is reasonable to the other authors.

Estimated effort using COCOMO [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COCOMO] metric:  47 Person Years

48 contributors (committers with at least one commit to cvs and/or subversion repository)


====First commit====

This commit was generated by cvs2svn to compensate for changes in r2,
which included commits to RCS files with non-trunk default branches.

Interesting to find out what happened before this administrative commit, as there were 6539 lines of code already.


====Last commit====

started to develop a mmcif parser
