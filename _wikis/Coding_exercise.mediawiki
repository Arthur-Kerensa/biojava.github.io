===Task 1===

Write a FASTA parser

Your solution should: 
* be a Java code of high quality (maintability, reusability, OO design, etc)
* be efficient
* be capable of reading badly formatted FASTA files
* be capable of reading large files
* has convenient API
* be possible to extend to reading FASTQ files 

Please refrain from using any libraries that are not part of a standard Java 6 development kit in your production code. For testing code fill free to use any library you feel comfortable with. 

===Task 2===
Write a FASTA writer

* Use your parser to read a FASTA file which contains sequences with ambiguous characters (you choose whether this is going to be ambiguous DNA or protein sequence)
* Write two FASTA output files one with sequences which contains ambiguous characters and another one without. 


===Submission===

Please submit your completed exercise to '''gsocexercise at gmail dot com''' by Friday the 6 of April inclusive. Your submission should be a ZIP archive that contains an executable JAR file with your FASTA parser and writer as well as 
* your source files in the ''src'' directory
* your documentation files in the ''docs'' directory 
* the test data file named data.fasta up to 10Kb in size 
* The executable JAR containing the program. This should be called ''runme.jar''. 
* a pure ASCII text file called ''choices.txt'' describing the significant design choices you made, uncertainties you had regarding the project, and the decisions you made when resolving them.
