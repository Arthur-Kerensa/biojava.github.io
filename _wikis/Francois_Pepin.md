I am a PhD student at the [McGill Center for
Bioinformatics](http://www.mcb.mcgill.ca). I spend most of my time doing
on microarray analysis, cleaning up databases and parsing data, not
always in that order. My coding alternates between Java and
R/Bioconductor, with a bit of C here and there. <category:People>
