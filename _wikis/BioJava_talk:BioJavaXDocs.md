Is there any usable version of biojavax? And, where can I find biosql
workable with biojava1.4?

Biojavax is currently only available from CVS (public or development
server). The BioSQL schema is also available from BioSQL the CVS.
Instructions for getting both can be found on the open-bio source code
[page](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/SourceCode).
