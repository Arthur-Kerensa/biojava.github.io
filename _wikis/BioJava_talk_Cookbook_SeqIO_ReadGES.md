these examples are describing the "old" biojava way. In the latest svn
they still work, but are labeled as deprecated and that the org.biojavax
interface should be used instead. Would be good to update this

Many of the examples in the cookbook use deprecated classes. As a n00b,
I am finding documentation of updated classes is lacking.
