[Scala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)) is a
programming language which interoperates (mostly) seamlessly with Java.
As such, it is possible to use BioJava from Scala code, or even mix
Scala and java code within a single package.

In addition to using BioJava classes in Scala code, there are several
libraries for bioinformatics written natively in Scala. These may feel
more natural to a Scala programmer than the equivalent BioJava
functions. See [BioScala](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bioscala/) or
[ScaBio](http://www.mi.hs-mannheim.de/gumbel/en/forschung/scabio/).
