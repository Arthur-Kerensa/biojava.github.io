Back to <GSoC:MSA>

Participants:
-------------

Mark, Kyle, Andreas

Report from last week:
----------------------

Mark: last week added global pairwise alignments, added a parallell
version. Guide tree building. Committed: concurrency tools, common
interface to a shared thread pool. A few interface classes return future
objects.

implemented in alignments, which is a static utility class

yesterday: added support for alternate scores

Andreas: We should use an example so one can easily trace how far the
module is at the present. Use piwi family as an example.

Would be easier to work with the forester library if we would have also
a source-jar. Will ask Scooter if he can provide a copy of the jar with
sources attached.

Outlook for this week
---------------------

basic progressive alignment profile - profile aligner use tree to build
up larger and larger profiles from individual sequences

things missing: getting local alignments done. SM

examples for users.

Other things
------------

Andreas: automated build is not ready yet (problems when running it on
the production server)

released the RCSB PDB sequence code as a new project in biojava-svn

Kyle: will add it to github

Mark: @override annotation - differences between Java 1.5 and Java 1.6
