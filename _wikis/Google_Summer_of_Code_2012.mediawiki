== Introduction ==

The Open Bioinformatics foundation is [http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code participating again in this year's Google Summer of Code].

We are accepting applicants for projects for BioJava. If you want to propose a project, have a look at the [[BioJava:Modules]] page, for areas which are currently under development. Also take a look at the [[BioJava3_Feature_Requests|Feature Requests]] page.

Please read the [http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code GSoC page at the Open Bioinformatics Foundation] and the [http://code.google.com/soc main Google Summer of Code page] for more details about the program.

=== Project Proposals ===

==== New File Parsers for BioJava ====

In the ideal word one would like to import the data from one program directly into another without having to do any file parsing, unfortunately in the real life this is not the case. Furthermore, having access to a wide variety of the file parsers is a prerequisite for any real work with the data. At least this is often the case in Bioinformatics. 

Yet, writing the file parsers is a tedious job that has to be done with care and consideration to achieve reliability and performance. So it is best to be done as a main task rather the afterthought of some other process. So if you want to help us to improve BioJava and spare users from a lot of complicate work choose this project!
There is plenty of scope for multi-threaded programming, advanced IO and complicated data structures to choose from, all depends on what you want. 

- UniProt

- [http://hmmer.janelia.org HMMER 3]

- [http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html Phylip]  

- [http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net MrBayes]

- Genbank (using XML format as input and one of the standard Java XML parsers with the aim to provide and example for people that is easy to follow)

- Tidy up existing parsers in BioJava, namely FASTA and FASTQ parsers

==== Take BioJava into the Cloud ====

- Hadoop-ify and/or Map-Reduce some of the BioJava modules

==== Port an Algorithm to Java ====

- Blast

- Hmmer
