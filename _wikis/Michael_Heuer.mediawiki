Michael Heuer is a long-time Biojava lurker and a rare contributor. Half-baked ideas and unfinished implementations of things that may make it into Biojava at some point can be found at his personal development site, dishevelled.org (http://www.dishevelled.org/).

Michael presented Biojava at BOSC 2005, Biojava spinoff project StAX (http://stax.sf.net) in a lightning talk at BOSC 2005, and Biojava at BOSC 2008.  See [[BOSC2008_Abstract]] and [[BOSC2008_Presentation]].
