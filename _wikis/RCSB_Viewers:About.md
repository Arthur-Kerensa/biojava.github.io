About RCSB Viewers
------------------

The *RCSB Viewers* suite of libraries provides the capability of
creating 3-d viewing applications. The libraries are Java based, and
rely on *JOGL* (Java *OpenGL*) to do the 3d rendering.

History
-------

The *RCSB Viewers* were initially implemented as a set of viewers over
the *MBT (Molecular Biology Toolkit) Library*, developed at the San
Diego Super Computing center. The *MBT Library* provided the base-level
support for structure definition, loading, and viewing.

Since then, as part of a major re-architecting effort, the visualization
and application functionality have been lifted out of the *MBT Library*,
with a view towards replacing it with *BioJava*. As a result, the *MBT
Library* (renamed and factored in this distribution as the *RCSB MBT
Libs*) has been reduced to simply the structure definition and loading
frameworks - the UI application and 3d visualization frameworks have
been factored into discrete projects.

Current Projects
