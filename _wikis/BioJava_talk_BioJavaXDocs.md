This page is getting a bit long. perhaps it would make sense to split it
into several sub-pages? - examples might better fit into the Cookbook
section.

Hi,

Is there any usable version of biojavax? And, where can I find biosql
workable with biojava1.4?

--[fishmacs](User:fishmacs "wikilink")

Biojavax is currently only available from CVS (public or development
server). The BioSQL schema is also available from BioSQL the CVS.
Instructions for getting both can be found on the open-bio source code
[page](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/SourceCode).

Hello, colleagues!

I've left some comments on my [discussion
page](User_talk:Seeker#I.27ve_noticed_some_misprints_in_BioJavaX_Documentation_and_in_the_source_code. "wikilink").
I think it may be interesting to contributors. Especially for BioJavaX
developers.
