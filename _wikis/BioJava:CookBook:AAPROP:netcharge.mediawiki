===How is Net Charge computed?===

The Net Charge of a protein sequence at a certain pH is computed using the following formulae.

In BioJava, the default pH used is 7.0. For more details and pKa values of amino acids used, please refer to this [http://www.innovagen.se/custom-peptide-synthesis/peptide-property-calculator/peptide-property-calculator-notes.asp#NetCharge website].<br/>
Do note that the pKa values referenced are based on Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, Third Edition.<br/>
Currently in the process of updating to 4th Edition.<br/>
