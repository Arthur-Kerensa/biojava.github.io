* My pleasure... Just sad to see people actaully thinking that we bioinformaticians need such artificial paradises ;-) As for limiting them, I don't know what can be done on our side, possibly asking the open-bio masters to institute some kind of filter. If Jason is still in charge, I could ask him.

* Hi, thanks for shutting out all those spammers in the last couple of days. Do you think we need to take other action to get rid of this problem? --[[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 03:38, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

* Just to let you know, we have had some problems on the othe Bio* wiki sites with spammers.  You should go ahead and create a <TT>Index.php</TT> page, then protect it for sysops only ([http://bioperl.org Bioperl] and [http://biopython.org Biopython] both resorted to this).  Also, the Bioperl and Biopython wikis have set up a Blacklist page which is supposed to cut down on the amount of spam.  Don't know if you have that here. --[[User:Cjfields|Cjfields]] 15:36, 11 August 2006 (EDT)

* I would be more than willing to do so! Jason S. got me admin priviliges on the BioJava site but I can't seem to be able to find it and his email address that I have is not responding anymore... I would need a small how-to on how to do what you propose though. Best regards. --[[User:Foisys|Foisys]] 10:24, 17 August 2006 (EDT)
