Code here didn't work for me (tested windows and linux blast, many
output formats), but using the code under
demobs/blastxml/BlastParser.java did work... also found several hits on
google of other people having the same issue. Consider replacing/adding
that here?-[Oneplus999](User:Oneplus999 "wikilink")

I recommend either posting the exact nature of the problem to the
mailing list, or if you fixed the problem, would be great if you could
create a new page for your solution and hook it up with the cookbook.
