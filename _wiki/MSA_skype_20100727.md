Back to <GSoC:MSA>

Participants:
-------------

Mark, Kyle, Andreas

Weekly Update
-------------

Mark: Lots of reading this week and a whole bunch of little
improvements. Cleaned up things a bit and removed compiler warnings.

Memory issues
-------------

Mark: Tested larger Pfam families. Turns out the Piwi family was just
big enough to fit into memory. (1.5GB) Snoal and Susd are too large to
fit into memory.

Current results: 800 sequences in Susd (278.5 average residues in
sequences). Raw sequences 619k in mysql Snoal: shorter sequences (168.6
average residue nr): 1000 sequences

Seems all of the pairwise alignments are still in memory when they are
not needed any more.

We will try to improve memory consumption

Structure alignments
--------------------

Andreas: Where are we regarding adding of structure alignment info as
additional input? Mark: Came also up during reading on variable gap
penalties. There are a number of possibilities how to deal with this.
(mentioned several options) A: many options, which one to take? K:
Simplest! M: Take the variable gap penalties and leave which constraints
are chose as a dimension of the alignment step.

Only 1 month left we should make sure we only do things that are
possible within this timeframe.

Outlook for this week
---------------------

Most important for the moment is to improve memory consumption

Pfam quality benchmarking
