I used BioJava for the [BioWeka](http://www.bioweka.org) project - this
was my Bachelor thesis. For this project I needed a class that read
[AAindex](http://www.genome.jp/aaindex/) files to analyze protein
sequences using symbol properties. So I've contributed the
`[http://www.bioservices.net/2005/10/aaindexstreamreader-for-biojava.html AAIndexStreamReader]`
class to the BioJava project. Another contributions is the
`[http://www.bioservices.net/2005/10/biojava-externalprocess-class.html ExternalProcess]`
class which is helpful if you like to execute an external program
multiple times and read/write its output/input without using the
filesystem but within multiple threads. Finally, I'm helping to get this
Wiki online ...

More information about me and my work (e.g. on XML, .NET and
Bioinformatics) can be found on my [homepage](http://szugat.gmxhome.de)
or just google for [Martin
Szugat](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Martin+Szugat%22).
