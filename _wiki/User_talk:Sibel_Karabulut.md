Hi;

I am preparing my master thesis related to genome. I am good at Java and
Linux, unix.. etc technical side, but I dont know genome terminology, I
try to read genome book, for developer they are so detailed, I need just
general terminology, file format like BAM, FASTA, SAM, and when I look
at inside of this file, I must understant.

So I need some book, web link or software to understand genome
terminology for development, not so much not so less, just for
development, just for understant file format.

I will wait your turn.

Best regards,

Sibel
